# WCA Competition Templates

::::: {.box .important}

### DO NOT use any templates before reading this entire document!

:::::

Here you can find printable templates for cube covers and clock covers, both of which are stackable; results boxes for scorecards: a design that can be hung on a wall and another that can be put on a table; Square-1 inserts (21 per page) and an outline of some important competition rules. There are also two 3D-printable clock cover designs.

## Instructions

1. If you would like to use the WCA designs, use the files in the folder for the language used in your region. **WARNING: Some of the PDF previews might have rendering artifacts, but these won't show up if you download the files.** If you would like to make custom designs, use the files in the `Editable Files` folder. **DO NOT** make colored clock cover designs, they must be in black and white (BW).

2. The designs for paper clock covers and competition rules can be printed on a home printer; the clock covers need to be printed in BW and the competition rules need to be printed in color. The other designs **MUST** be printed using an industry-grade printer, so you will have to find a printing place in your area. They will require `.PDF` files to make your prints.

3. If you are making **custom clock covers**, you will need to copy your finished design to a new A4-sized document (210\*297mm / 8.27\*11.69in), rotate the whole design 12 degrees counterclockwise and save the file as PDF. If you are printing them on a regular office printer that can’t print all the way to the edges, try selecting the setting “fit to printable area”.

4. There are two 3D-printable clock cover designs: one made by Mitchell Lane and one made by Cady Shields. Mitchell's design can stack, while Cady's design does not stack, but is more sturdy and can fit clocks with a thicker outer shell (clocks like this have never been mass-produced, only custom made). Both of these 3D clock cover designs last much longer than the paper version. We recommend that you look for a 3D printing service in your area or try to find a 3D printing enthusiast who could make them for you.

5. Make sure you print all templates **STRICTLY** within the following specifications (**covers printed using different specifications can be unfit for WCA competitions to the extent of some results being removed afterwards**):

| Template               | Paper size | Paper thickness | Paper type |
| ---------------------- | :--------: | :-------------- | :--------- |
| Cube cover             |     A3     | 350-400 gsm \*  | Color      |
| Paper clock cover \*\* |     A4     | 60-90 gsm       | BW         |
| Results box (table)    |     A3     | 350-400 gsm \*  | Color      |
| Results box (wall)     |     A4     | 250-400 gsm     | Color      |
| Square-1 inserts       |     A4     | 250-400 gsm     | Color      |
| Competition rules      |     A4     | Any             | Color      |

"gsm" stands for grams per square meter. This is the standard unit of measurement for paper thickness.

\* Thicker is better

\*\* Clock covers are printed on standard printing paper used in regular BW office printers. 80 gsm is the best option.

| Template                           | Resolution     | Infill     |  Filament  | Rafts | Supports |
| ---------------------------------- | :------------- | :--------- | :--------: | :---: | :------- |
| 3D clock cover (Cady's design)     | 0.2-0.3mm      | 15%        |    PLA     |  Any  | None \*  |
| 3D clock cover (Mitchell's design) | 0.2-0.3mm \*\* | 15% \*\*\* | PLA / PETG | None  | None     |

\* None are needed when printing upright

\*\* 0.24mm recommended

\*\*\* No infill will be generated

6. You will need the following tools in order to assemble the paper prints:

-   Scissors
-   Ruler
-   Paper glue (only for clock covers)
-   Double-sided tape up to 1cm in width (only for results boxes and cube covers)
-   Blade (knife, box cutter, etc.) (only for results boxes and cube covers)

7. On all templates except for the clock covers, make all cuts on the **INNER** side of the black lines, leaving no black color visible after the cuts are done. On the clock cover the cuts need to be made **THROUGH** the black lines.
