The following printable templates are available for you to use at WCA competitions:

- Stackable puzzle covers
- Stackable Clock covers
- 3D-printable cover designs for Square-1, Clock, and Skewb puzzles
- Boxes for score sheets: one to put on a table and another to hang on a wall
- Square-1 inserts (21 per page)
- Competitor guide infographic with illustrations of the most important rules
- 3x3x3 Multi-Blind scrambling infographic with illustrations that show best practices
- Sheets with square outlines for tracking Multi-Blind scrambles (14 cubes per page)

## Instructions

1. If you want to use the WCA designs, use the files in the folder for the language used in your region, if available. If you are going to make custom designs, use the files in the `Editable Files` folder. ****Do not**** make Clock cover designs that use a lot of ink because that makes the paper more rigid and may push Clock pins. It is preferable to have a minimal design in Black and White (BW).
2. You can print the template for paper Clock covers, the infographics, and the Multi-Blind cube outlines sheet on a home printer. Print the infographics in color and the other two files in BW. You will need to find a printing service with an industry-grade printer to print the remaining templates. They will require `.pdf` files to make your prints.

3. If you are making **custom Clock covers**, copy your finished design to a new A4-sized document (210\*297mm / 8.27\*11.69in), rotate the whole design 12 degrees counterclockwise, and save the file as `.pdf`. If you are printing them on a regular office printer that cannot print all the way to the edges, try selecting the setting “fit to printable area”.

4. There are two 3D-printable cover designs: one for Clock and one that fits Square-1, Clock, and Skewb puzzles. Both are stackable. The multipurpose cover fits any Clock ≤ 24mm (0.94 inch) in thickness and any Square-1 or Skewb ≤ 57mm (2.24 inch) and prevents accidental turns from being applied to the puzzle during transit. 3D-printed covers last much longer and work better than paper or card alternatives, but they are more expensive to produce. You should look for a 3D printing service in your area or try to find a 3D printing enthusiast who can print them for you.

5. Ensure you print every template **strictly** within the following specifications:

| Template                                | Paper size | Paper density  | Color / BW |
| --------------------------------------- | :--------: | :------------- | :--------: |
| Puzzle cover                              |     A3     | 350-400 gsm \* |   Color    |
| Paper Clock cover \*\*                  |     A4     | 60-90 gsm      |     BW     |
| Results box (table)                     |     A3     | 350-400 gsm \* |   Color    |
| Results box (wall)                      |     A4     | 250-400 gsm    |   Color    |
| Square-1 inserts                        |     A4     | 250-400 gsm    |   Color    |
| Competitor/Multi-Blind scrambling guide |     A4     | Any            |   Color    |
| Multi-Blind cube outlines sheet         |     A4     | Any            |     BW     |

“gsm” stands for grams per square meter. It is the standard unit of measurement for paper density.

\* Thicker is better. <br/>
\*\* Clock covers are printed on standard paper for regular BW office printers. 80 gsm is the best option.

| Template              | Resolution | Infill |  Filament  | Supports |
| --------------------- | :--------: | :----: | :--------: | :------: |
| 3D multipurpose cover | 0.2-0.3 mm  |  15%   | PLA / PETG |   None   |
| 3D Clock cover        |   0.4 mm    | 15% \* | PLA / PETG |   None   |

\* If needed.

6. You will need the following tools to assemble the paper prints:

- scissors
- ruler
- paper glue (only for Clock covers)
- double-sided tape up to 1 cm in width (only for results boxes and puzzle covers)
- blade (e.g. knife or box cutter) for score sheet boxes and puzzle covers

7. Make all cuts on the **inner** side of the black lines on every template except for the Clock covers, leaving no black color visible. Make the cuts **through** the black lines on the Clock cover.

8. The Multi-Blind cube outlines file has multiple pages, each with numbered spots for 14 cubes (i.e. two TNoodle scramble sets). The first page is for scrambles 1-14, the second is for 15-28, and so on, all the way up to scramble 84. You can print out as many of these as you require for your competition. Consider how many scramblers you will have and how many cubes your competitors will be attempting. You can continue reusing these sheets for future competitions to avoid wasting paper.

When scrambling a Multi-Blind attempt, place each cube on the number of the applied scramble. Also, ensure you never have two people scrambling cubes using the same cube outlines sheet. Remember that one of these sheets corresponds to two TNoodle scramble sheets since those have seven scrambles per page. All of this greatly reduces the risk of applying the same scramble twice, which could result in the competitor receiving an extra attempt, which is a big hindrance to the flow of a competition.
