# WCA Competition Templates

::::: {.box .important}
DO NOT use any templates before reading this entire document!
:::::

Here you can find printable templates for cube covers and Clock covers, both of which are stackable; 3D-printable cover designs for Square-1, Clock and Skewb puzzles; results boxes for scorecards: a design that can be hung on a wall and another that can be put on a table; Square-1 inserts (21 per page) and an outline of some important competition rules.

## Instructions

1. If you would like to use the WCA designs, use the files in the folder for the language used in your region. **WARNING: Some of the PDF previews might have rendering artifacts, but these won't show up if you download the files.** If you would like to make custom designs, use the files in the `Editable Files` folder. **DO NOT** make colored Clock cover designs, they must be in black and white (BW).
2. The designs for paper Clock covers and competition rules can be printed on a home printer; the Clock covers need to be printed in BW and the competition rules need to be printed in color. The other designs **MUST** be printed using an industry-grade printer, so you will have to find a printing place in your area. They will require `PDF` files to make your prints.

3. If you are making **custom Clock covers**, you will need to copy your finished design to a new A4-sized document (210\*297mm / 8.27\*11.69in), rotate the whole design 12 degrees counterclockwise and save the file as PDF. If you are printing them on a regular office printer that can’t print all the way to the edges, try selecting the setting “fit to printable area”.

4. There are three 3D-printable cover designs: two for Clocks and one that fits Square-1, Clock and Skewb puzzles. Francisco's Clock design is stackable, while Cady's design isn't, but is more sturdy and can fit Clocks with a thicker outer shell (clocks like this have never been mass-produced, only custom made). The multipurpose cover is stackable, fits any Clock <= 24mm (0.94in) in thickness and any Square-1/Skewb <= 57mm (2.24in), and prevents accidental turns being applied to the puzzle during transit. 3D-printed covers last much longer and work better than the paper/card alternatives, but are more difficult and expensive to produce. We recommend that you look for a 3D printing service in your area or try to find a 3D printing enthusiast who could print them for you.

5. Make sure you print all templates **STRICTLY** within the following specifications:
:::::

| Template               | Paper size | Paper density  | Paper type |
| ---------------------- | :--------: | :------------- | :--------: |
| Cube cover             |     A3     | 350-400 gsm \* |   Color    |
| Paper Clock cover \*\* |     A4     | 60-90 gsm      |     BW     |
| Results box (table)    |     A3     | 350-400 gsm \* |   Color    |
| Results box (wall)     |     A4     | 250-400 gsm    |   Color    |
| Square-1 inserts       |     A4     | 250-400 gsm    |   Color    |
| Competition rules      |     A4     | Any            |   Color    |

"gsm" stands for grams per square meter. This is the standard unit of measurement for paper density.

\* Thicker is better.<br/>
\*\* Clock covers are printed on standard printing paper used in regular BW office printers. 80 gsm is the best option.

| Template                            | Resolution |  Infill  |  Filament  | Rafts | Supports |
| ----------------------------------- | :--------: | :------: | :--------: | :---: | :------: |
| 3D multipurpose cover               | 0.2-0.3mm  |   15%    | PLA / PETG | None  |   None   |
| 3D Clock cover (Francisco's design) |   0.4mm    | 15% \*\* | PLA / PETG | None  |   None   |
| 3D Clock cover (Cady's design)      | 0.2-0.3mm  |   15%    |    PLA     |  Any  | None \*  |

\* None are needed when printing upright.<br/>
\*\* If needed.

6. You will need the following tools in order to assemble the paper prints:

- Scissors
- Ruler
- Paper glue (only for Clock covers)
- Double-sided tape up to 1cm in width (only for results boxes and cube covers)
- Blade (knife, box cutter, etc.) (only for results boxes and cube covers)

7. On all templates except for the Clock covers, make all cuts on the **INNER** side of the black lines, leaving no black color visible after the cuts are done. On the Clock cover the cuts need to be made **THROUGH** the black lines.
