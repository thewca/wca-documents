# WCA Competition Templates

::::: {.box .important}
DO NOT use any templates before reading this entire document!

Here you can find the following printable templates that can be used for WCA competitions:

- Cube covers and Clock covers, both stackable
- 3D-printable cover designs for Square-1, Clock, and Skewb puzzles
- Results boxes for scorecards: one that can be put on a table and another that can be hung on a wall
- Square-1 inserts (21 per page)
- Competitor guide infographic with illustrations of the most important rules
- Multi-Blind scrambling infographic, with illustrations that show best practices
- Sheets with cube outlines for tracking Multi-Blind scrambles (14 cubes per page)

## Instructions

1. If you would like to use the WCA designs, use the files in the folder for the language used in your region, if available. If you would like to make custom designs, use the files in the `Editable Files` folder. **DO NOT** make Clock cover designs that use a lot of ink, because that makes the paper more rigid, which can affect Clock pins. It is preferable to have a minimal design in Black and White (BW).
2. The template for paper Clock covers, the infographics, and the Multi-Blind cube outlines sheet can be printed on a home printer. The infographics need to be printed in color, and the other two files need to be printed in BW. All other templates **MUST** be printed using an industry-grade printer, so you will have to find a printing service in your area. They will require `.pdf` files to make your prints.

3. If you are making **custom Clock covers**, you will need to copy your finished design to a new A4-sized document (210\*297mm / 8.27\*11.69in), rotate the whole design 12 degrees counterclockwise and save the file as `.pdf`. If you are printing them on a regular office printer that can’t print all the way to the edges, try selecting the setting “fit to printable area”.

4. There are two 3D-printable cover designs: one for Clock and one that fits Square-1, Clock and Skewb puzzles. Both are stackable. The multipurpose cover fits any Clock ≤ 24mm (0.94in) in thickness and any Square-1/Skewb ≤ 57mm (2.24in), and prevents accidental turns being applied to the puzzle during transit. 3D-printed covers last much longer and work better than the paper/card alternatives, but are more expensive to produce. It is recommended that you look for a 3D printing service in your area or try to find a 3D printing enthusiast who could print them for you.

5. Make sure you print all templates **STRICTLY** within the following specifications:

| Template                                | Paper size | Paper density  | Color / BW |
| --------------------------------------- | :--------: | :------------- | :--------: |
| Cube cover                              |     A3     | 350-400 gsm \* |   Color    |
| Paper Clock cover \*\*                  |     A4     | 60-90 gsm      |     BW     |
| Results box (table)                     |     A3     | 350-400 gsm \* |   Color    |
| Results box (wall)                      |     A4     | 250-400 gsm    |   Color    |
| Square-1 inserts                        |     A4     | 250-400 gsm    |   Color    |
| Competitor/Multi-Blind scrambling guide |     A4     | Any            |   Color    |
| Multi-Blind cube outlines sheet         |     A4     | Any            |     BW     |

"gsm" stands for grams per square meter. This is the standard unit of measurement for paper density.

\* Thicker is better.<br/>
\*\* Clock covers are printed on standard printing paper used for regular BW office printers. 80 gsm is the best option.

| Template              | Resolution | Infill |  Filament  | Supports |
| --------------------- | :--------: | :----: | :--------: | :------: |
| 3D multipurpose cover | 0.2-0.3mm  |  15%   | PLA / PETG |   None   |
| 3D Clock cover        |   0.4mm    | 15% \* | PLA / PETG |   None   |

\* If needed.

6. You will need the following tools in order to assemble the paper prints:

- Scissors
- Ruler
- Paper glue (only for Clock covers)
- Double-sided tape up to 1cm in width (only for results boxes and cube covers)
- Blade (knife, box cutter, etc.) (only for results boxes and cube covers)

7. On all templates except for the Clock covers, make all cuts on the **INNER** side of the black lines, leaving no black color visible after the cuts are done. On the Clock cover the cuts need to be made **THROUGH** the black lines.

8. The Multi-Blind cube outlines file has multiple pages, each of them with numbered spots for 14 cubes (two TNoodle scramble sets). The first page is for scrambles 1-14, the second is for 15-28, and so on, all the way up to scramble 84. You can print out as many of these as you require for your competition. Consider how many scramblers you will have, and how many cubes your competitors will be attempting. You can continue reusing these sheets for future competitions so as not to waste paper.

When scrambling a Multi-Blind attempt, place each cube on the number of the scramble that was applied to it. Also make sure you never have two people scrambling cubes using the same cube outlines sheet (remember that one of these sheets corresponds to two TNoodle scramble sheets, since those have 7 scrambles per page). All of this greatly reduces the risk of applying the same scramble twice, which could result in the competitor receiving an extra, which is a big hindrance to the flow of a competition.
