# Venue Setup

Since there will be dozens of people for several hours in the same place, having a well-set-up venue will not only considerably improve competitors’ and guests’ experiences but also save you from many logistical issues. There are several different areas that make up your venue, so let’s go through each of them.

## Definitions

Before going through the details of each area, here are a few definitions you should be aware of:

- The **score-taking table** is where results are going to be entered into [WCA Live](https://live.worldcubeassociation.org/) or a spreadsheet. These results are for competitors to know their ranking and for you to use to determine podiums and the competitors advancing to subsequent rounds.
- The **scrambling table** is where scramblers are seated to scramble the puzzles of the groups currently solving.
- The **puzzle drop-off table** is where competitors submit their puzzles before the start of their group.
- The **solving stations** are the tables where competitors will be doing their solves.

## Registration Table & Score-taking

There are several reasons you might need to keep track of the number of competitors, such as venue requirements, collecting registration money, or handing out participation certificates or souvenirs. You should have a registration table with someone available throughout the day to check in guests and competitors. If possible, the table should be right next to the entrance so you do not miss anyone.

One useful approach for smaller competitions (e.g. 20-60 competitors) is to combine the score-taking table and the registration table. This makes it easier to ensure that the table is always occupied by a staff member. You should have additional staff available at the registration table during specific times, such as at the start of the competition and just before the main event, as those are when most people arrive at the venue.

Alternatively, you could combine the score-taking table with the scrambling table so that when the completed score sheets return to the scrambling area, they can immediately be given to the score takers. However, at larger competitions, it is better to have the score-taking table in a separate area or room reserved for the organization team.

## Spectator Area

It is important that the spectators have a good and clear view of most solving stations and displays. You should try to keep the audience reasonably close to the solving stations, but remember that there must be a minimum distance of 1.5 meters per Regulation [7b](wca{regulations/#7b}). Also, be aware that besides guests, you will also have many competitors spectating, so ensure you have enough chairs.

The WCA website’s online registration allows you to ask competitors how many guests they will bring. This could help you give a better idea of how many spectators you might have on the competition day.

## Scrambling Table

The scrambling table should be reasonably close to the solving stations so that it does not take too long for judges (or “[runners](wcadoc{edudoc/organizer-guidelines/running-systems.pdf})”) to pick up puzzles and move them from the scrambling table to the solving stations and vice versa. There should also be some sort of visual barrier to ensure competitors or guests cannot see scramblers while they are scrambling puzzles.

At smaller competitions, the puzzle drop-off table is often the scrambling table. If you are using a separate puzzle drop-off table, ensure that it is not too far from the scrambling table to make it easier for runners to transport the puzzles.

## Waiting Area

You should have an area for competitors to wait in between solves until they are called. Again, this should be close to the solving stations to avoid walking unnecessarily long distances, but you must do your best to make it so that competitors in the waiting area cannot easily see people solving. A good idea in the absence of a visual barrier is to have chairs in the waiting area facing **away** from the solving stations. You could also use a stationary system, in which each competitor stays at the same solving station throughout the whole group. If you use a stationary system over a non-stationary system, be mindful that it is easier for competitors to see the scrambles of other competitors, so you should be ensuring that competitors are not watching other competitors solve while they are waiting.

In final rounds where competitors are called to compete at different times but compete with the same scramble set, you will need to isolate those who have not yet been called to compete from those who are already solving. That can be done by having the competitors wait in a separate room or with a barrier blocking the solving stations from their view.

## Solving Stations

You need to be careful with the lighting at solving stations since it is where the solves take place. Ensure every station is well-lit and that the lighting does not affect the color recognition on any puzzle. You should also try to keep this area at a comfortable temperature, ideally 20 to 25 degrees Celsius, to avoid any negative impact on the competitors. Besides that, the stations should be arranged in such a way that most of them can be seen by the audience. If you are using several rows of stations, consider having a small, elevated stage for the stations at the back so that they are still visible. If you are going to use cables instead of batteries for the displays, you should place the stations near the power sockets and also have enough extension cords if needed. Consider taping the cables down so people do not trip over them during the competition. Also, consider numbering every solving station and putting a label with its number on each table. This can be convenient for organizers, runners, judges, and even competitors. You could also have a screen that shows the competitors where they will be solving to make the process smoother.

For 3x3x3 Fewest Moves, there can be more competitors per table compared to regular speedsolving events. Since it is not an event where spectators get to see much, you do not need to worry about all the competitors being visible to the audience. However, you should still place them in a way that the Delegates and/or the judges for the attempt can see all the competitors and ensure no one is close enough to copy a solution from another competitor.
