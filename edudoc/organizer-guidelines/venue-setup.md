# Venue Setup

Since you are going to have dozens of people for several hours in the same place, having a well-setup venue will not only drastically improve competitor and guests’ experiences, but also save you from many logistical issues. There are several different areas that make up your venue, so let’s go through each of them.

## Definitions

Before going through the details of each area, there are a few definitions you should be aware of:

- The **score-taking table** is where results are going to be uploaded to [WCA Live](https://live.worldcubeassociation.org/) or entered in a spreadsheet for competitors to know their ranking and also for you to use the results to determine podiums, which competitors should advance to subsequent rounds, etc.
- The **scrambling table** is where scramblers are seated to scramble the puzzles of the groups currently solving.
- The **puzzle drop-off table** is where competitors submit their puzzles before the start of their group.
- The **solving stations** are the tables where competitors will be doing their solves.

## Registration table & score-taking

There are several reasons you may need to keep track of the number of competitors: venue requirement; collecting registration money; handing out participation certificates, souvenirs, etc. You should have a registration table with someone available throughout the day to check-in guests and competitors and, if possible, the table should be right next to the entrance so you do not miss anyone.

One useful approach for smaller competitions (e.g. 20-60 competitors) is to merge the score-taking and the registration table into one. That way you avoid having a staff member unoccupied when there are fewer people coming in, although you should have extra staff available at the registration table during certain times, such as at the start of the competition and just before the main event, as those are when most people arrive at the venue. Alternatively, you can combine the score-taking table with the scrambling table, so that when the completed scorecards return to the scrambling area, they can immediately be given to the score-taker(s). However, at larger competitions it is better to have the score-taking table in a separate room, usually the room reserved for the organization team.

## Spectator area

It is important that the spectators can have a good and clear view of most solving stations and displays. You should try to keep the audience reasonably close to the solving stations, but keep in mind that there must be a minimum distance of 1.5 meters per Regulation [7b](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#7b). Also, be aware that besides guests, you will also have many competitors spectating, so make sure you have enough chairs.

The WCA website’s online registration allows you to ask competitors how many guests they will bring, so that may be useful for you to get a better idea of how many spectators you may have on the competition day.

## Scrambling table

The scrambling table should be reasonably close to the solving stations so that it does not take too long for judges (or “[runners](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/edudoc/organizer-guidelines/running-systems.pdf)”) to pick up puzzles and move them from the scrambling table to the solving stations and vice-versa. There should also be some sort of visual barrier to ensure competitors or guests cannot see the scrambles.

The puzzle drop-off table can simply be the scrambling table (usually done at smaller competitions). If you are using a separate puzzle drop-off table, make sure that it is not too far from the scrambling table in order to make it easier for runners to transport the puzzles.

## Waiting area

You should have an area for competitors to wait in between solves until they are called. Again, this should be close to the solving stations in order to avoid walking unnecessarily long distances, but you must do your best to make it so that competitors in the waiting area cannot easily see people solving. A good idea in absence of any visual barriers is to have chairs in the waiting area facing **away** the solving stations. You may also use a stationary system, in which all competitors stay at the same solving station throughout the whole group, but you should only do that in particular circumstances on special cases (e.g. Final rounds, or groups where all competitors can be placed far from each other) since this system makes it easier for competitors to see the scrambles of other competitors.

For finals where competitors are called to compete at different times but compete with the same scramble set, you will need to isolate those who have not yet been called to compete from those who are already solving. That can be done by having the competitors wait in a separated room, or with some sort of barrier blocking the solving stations from their view.

## Solving stations

This is where solves will take place, so you need to be extra careful with the lighting. Make sure all the stations are well lit and that the lighting does not affect the color recognition on any puzzle. You should also try to keep this area in a comfortable temperature (usually around 20 to 25 degrees Celsius) to avoid any negative impact on the competitors. Besides that, the stations should be arranged in such a way that most of them can be seen by the audience. If you are using several rows of stations, consider having a small, elevated stage for the back stations so that they are still visible. For the displays, if you are going to use cables instead of batteries, you should place the stations near the power sockets and also have enough extension leads if needed. Consider taping the cables down so people do not trip over them during the competition. Also, consider numbering all of your solving stations and putting labels on each table with its number. This can be very convenient for organizers, runners, judges and even competitors. You could also have a screen that shows the competitors where they will be solving to make the process smoother.

For 3x3x3 Fewest Moves, you may have more competitors per station compared to regular speedsolving events, and since it is not an event where spectators get to see much, you do not have to worry about all the competitors being visible to the audience. However, you should still place them in a way that the Delegate(s) and/or the judge(s) for the attempt can see all the competitors, and make sure no one is close enough to copy solutions from another competitor.
