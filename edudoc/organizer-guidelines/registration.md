# Handling Registrations

To handle the competition registrations, you may either use the WCA website or an external website, such as your Regional Organization’s website. Using the WCA website for registrations will make it easier to use tools such as [WCA Live](https://github.com/thewca/wca-live/wiki/Guide) or [Groupifier](https://groupifier.jonatanklosko.com/). If you are using an external website, you would first need to import the registrations to the WCA website for these tools to work. Regardless of the website you are using, the process is going to be similar. Ensure you are doing it properly since poor registration management can lead to many issues and cause bad experiences for many people.

## Registration Requirements

It is important that you make the registration requirements clear on the competition website and that every competitor is subject to the same requirements. A registration is only considered complete if the competitor fulfills **all** of the requirements established (e.g. paying the registration fee). A competitor is **ineligible** to compete if the registration is incomplete (see Regulation [2c1](wca{regulations/#2c1})). If something unusual occurs with a competitor’s registration, contact your Delegate to find a solution.

Once the registration period starts, the registrations will need to be manually approved. You will see an additional list on the registration tab with all the registrations pending approval. Be aware that taking too long to accept registrations once the requirements have been met could reflect badly on the organization team and could lead competitors (especially first-time competitors) to believe they have done something incorrectly or that something went wrong with their registration. You do not need to accept every registration within minutes, but ensure you accept them in two days at most to avoid issues.

If you have more completed registrations than the competitor limit, a waiting list is set in place. Once a spot is available, competitors must be accepted in the order that their registration is completed. To prevent people from wasting spots, you could remind competitors to inform the organization team if they are not going to attend the competition so that their spot can be given to the first person on the waiting list. Remember that a competitor may only join the waiting list **after** their registration is completed. Once a spot is available, competitors on the waiting list must be accepted in the order that their registration was completed.

If a person is unable to fulfill one of the registration requirements (e.g. the competitor is from another country and cannot use the payment method indicated on the competition website), the organization team and the Delegates may find alternative means for this specific person (e.g. paying on the spot) if the Delegates deems it fair. Such alternatives must always be coordinated with the Delegate and be based on fairness rather than mistakes that were made by the competitor, such as missing the registration deadline.

## Making Changes to the Requirements

Even though making changes to the requirements is sometimes a possibility, it should only happen in **exceptional** circumstances. You should avoid changes as much as possible. **Every** update on the registration requirements needs to first be approved by the listed Delegates, and some also require approval by the WCA Competition Announcement Team. If you need to make any changes, communicate with your Delegates early since it could take a few days for the requirements to be updated.

You may change the requirements as the competition date gets closer (e.g. increase the registration fees or restrict which events a competitor can register for), but you should inform the competitors of any intended change in advance via the competition website or email.

Changes that affect registered competitors _must_ be clearly announced. Be consistent with what is on the competition website. For example, you _must not_ accept registrations on the spot if the competition website says they will not be available.

## On the Competition Day

You should have a [registration table](wcadoc{edudoc/organizer-guidelines/venue-setup.pdf}) and must strictly follow the registration requirements on the competition website. Depending on the registration requirements set in advance, you might consider allowing on-the-spot registrations only for some events, allowing on-the-spot registrations for all the events, or not allowing on-the-spot registrations. If you are accepting on-the-spot registrations, when registering first-time competitors, you need to get their relevant information (i.e. citizenship, email address, date of birth, name, and gender) so that the information can be assigned to their results and WCA ID. Ensure that the relevant information gathered from first-time competitors is well stored at all times. Other people should not have access to such sensitive information.
