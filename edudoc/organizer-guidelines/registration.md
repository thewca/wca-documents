# Handling registrations

To handle the registrations, you can either use the WCA website or an external third-party one, such as your regional organization’s website. Using the WCA website for registrations will make it easier to use tools such as [WCA Live](https://github.com/thewca/wca-live/wiki/Guide) or [Groupifier](https://groupifier.jonatanklosko.com/). If you are using an external website, you would first need to import the registrations to the WCA website for these to work. Regardless of the website you are using, the process is going to be roughly the same. Be sure you are doing it properly, since poor registration management can lead to many issues and cause bad experiences for many people.

## Registration requirements

It is important that you make the registration requirements clear on the competition website and that every competitor is subject to the same requirements. A registration is only considered complete if the competitor fulfilled **all** of the requirements established (e.g. Paying the registration fee). A competitor is **not** eligible to compete if the registration is not complete (see Regulation [2c1](wca{regulations/#2c1})). If something weird occurs with a competitor's registration, contact your Delegate to find a solution.

Once the registration period starts, the registrations will have to be manually approved. You will see an extra list on the registration tab with all the registrations pending approval. Be aware that taking too long to accept registrations once the requirements have been met can reflect badly on the organizational team and may lead competitors (especially new-comers) to believe they have done something incorrectly or that something went wrong with their registration. You do not have to accept every registration within minutes, but be sure to accept them in two days at most in order to avoid any issue.

If you have more completed registrations than the competitor limit, a waiting list is set in place. Once a spot is available, competitors must be accepted in the order that their registration was completed. In order to avoid people wasting available spots you should remind competitors to inform the organization team if they are not going to attend the competition so that their spot can be given to the first person on the waiting list. Keep in mind that a competitor can only join the waiting list **after** their registration is completed. Once a spot is available, competitors on the waiting list must be accepted in the order that their registration was completed.

If an individual is unable to fulfill one of the registration requirements (e.g. Someone from another country attending the competition might not be able to use the payment method indicated on the competition website) the organization team and the Delegate(s) may find alternative means for this specific individual (e.g. Paying on the spot) if the Delegate(s) deems it fair. Such alternatives must always be coordinated with the Delegate and be based on fairness rather than mistakes that were made by the competitor, such as missing the registration deadline.

## Making changes to the requirements

Even though making changes is sometimes a possibility, it should only happen in **exceptional** circumstances and you should avoid changes as much as possible. **Every** update on the registration requirements needs to first be approved by the competition Delegate(s), and later by the WCA Competition Announcement Team. If you need to make any changes, do not wait until the last minute to communicate with your Delegate(s) as it may take a few days until the requirements can be updated.

You may change the requirements as the competition gets closer (e.g. Increase the registration fees, restrict which events a competitor can register for), but you should inform the competitors of any intended change in advance through the competition website or via email.

::::: {.box .important}
Changes that affect registered competitors _must_ be clearly announced. Be consistent with what is in the competition website. For example, you _must not_ accept registrations on the spot if the competition website said they wouldn’t be available.

## On the competition day

You should have a [registration table](wcadoc{edudoc/organizer-guidelines/venue-setup.pdf}) and strictly follow the registration requirements on the competition website. Depending on the registration requirements set in advance, you may choose to accept on the spot registrations only for certain events , to accept on the spot registrations for all the events, or to not have on the spot registrations at all. In case you are accepting on the spot registrations, when registering new-comers you need to get their relevant information (citizenship, e-mail address, date of birth, name, and gender) so that the information can be assigned to their results and WCA ID. Make sure that the relevant information gathered from new-comers is well stored at all times since it is sensitive information and as such other people should not have access to them.

For more information on how registrations should be handled, see the [WCA Competitions Requirement Policy](wcadoc{documents/policies/external/Competition%20Requirements.pdf}).
