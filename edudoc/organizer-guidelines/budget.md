# Budgeting a Competition

Properly budgeting your competition is crucial to improving the overall quality and avoiding financial loss. While budgeting, strive to answer the following questions:

## What Expenses Are There?

Making a list with all the expenses is a great way to start and estimate how much you need to collect from registration fees or if you need to find a cheaper venue.

- Is the venue free? If not, how much does it cost?
- Does the venue require liability insurance coverage? If so, how much does it cost?
- Do you need to pay the venue to set up anything?
- Is there an additional fee for having venue staff present on the competition days? If so, how much?
- Does the venue demand any percentage of the money collected from the registrations?
- Do the Delegates live near the competition venue? Will you need to cover any of their expenses? If so, which ones?
  - You should always try to get the closest Delegate possible to lower the expenses. Nevertheless, Delegate expenses must only include costs incurred directly from attending the competition as a listed Delegate. For more information on covering Delegates’ expenses, see the finance section of the [Code of Ethics](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf}).
- Do you need to rent tables or chairs?
- Do you need to rent audio or visual equipment?
- Are competitors receiving prizes? How much do those cost?
- Are there any souvenirs for the competitors (e.g. keychains, pens, or stickers)?
- If selling merchandise is being considered to offset costs, how much will the merchandise cost to produce?
- What are the costs for printing name tags, score sheets, schedule printouts, posters, and other printables?

## What Are the Sources of Income?

Registration fees are the most common way to collect money for your competition. If you are relying on registration fees, estimate the minimum number of competitors you are expecting while calculating expected income. Guest fees are another, but far less common, source of income. Do your best to keep registration and guest fees reasonably low (especially guest fees), as high costs might make your competition unattractive or inaccessible for competitors and spectators.

To lower registration fees, you could sell merchandise (e.g. shirts, mugs, or bags), enable donations on the registration site, or receive financial help from sponsors (e.g. cube stores, local companies, or the venue giving a reduced rate.). If you plan on selling merchandise, check whether sales are allowed inside the venue on the competition day. Remember that your local laws might prohibit you or make it financially sustainable for you (e.g. due to taxes or fees) to sell merchandise.

When drafting a budget heavily relying on registration fees, you should distinguish between the competitor limit and the minimum number of competitors you expect to attend. Usually, it will be safer to draft the budget based on the minimum number of expected competitors to avoid financial loss. However, please consider how realistic the numbers are and find a compromise for what you believe is reasonable.

Listing every source of income and comparing them to the expenses can help you see whether the total income matches or exceeds the expenses. If the expenses exceed the total income, you must find a way to raise more funds. Try to raise more funds than your expected expenses to be prepared when something goes wrong. If you are going to rely primarily on registrations, it is good to use online payment to avoid the issue of being at a loss due to too many no-shows at the competition. Waiving registration fees for competitors must follow section 1.3 of the [Code of Ethics](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf}).

Remember that you **cannot** make a personal profit by organizing a competition! Please consider the Finances section of the [Code of Ethics](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf}) when making your competition budget. If you have leftover funds at the end of your competition, discuss the best use with your Delegates.
:::::

If you require competitors to pay the registration fee in advance, the organization team and Delegates should coordinate who will process the payments and perform the necessary shopping. Remember that when you have a Regional Organization in the competition’s region, it might be preferable for it to process the payments due to potential taxation laws.

### Example budget

Here is an example budget that could work for your competition. Be organized when writing it down to make tracking things easier. If your net profit is **negative**, adjust your expenses and income to avoid significant financial loss. For a more complete list of the expenses you might have, see the budget section of the [competition checklist](wcadoc{edudoc/organizer-guidelines/checklist.pdf}).
