# Enhancing Competitor and Volunteer Experience

This is a guide to help organizers identify some resources and suggestions they can use as organizers to enhance competitor, spectator, and volunteer experience at their competitions.

## Communication

### Badges and lanyards

Badges and lanyards can be used to give competitors group and volunteer information in a way that makes it easy to access and understand.

### Online resources

Online resources can be used to benefit competitors, spectators, sponsors, and organizers. Here are a few online resources you can share with competitors and explanations of why they are useful:

- Important competition information, such as group information and volunteer assignments
- Tutorials for events to help boost competitor numbers for those events
- A sponsor’s homepage to increase revenue for your sponsor, enabling them to better cover prize or venue cost
- Travel information to help competitors and volunteers better plan their traveling routes and show them their options for lodging

### Posters

Posters can be used to provide information to competitors and spectators. Here are a few ways they can be used:

- Remind people of things they should and should not do (e.g. please stay quiet, do not use flash photography, stay 1.5 meters away from competitors whiel they are competing).
- Label areas of importance (e.g. waiting area, quiet room, spectator seating).
- Convey group information and/or volunteer responsibilities and assignments to competitors by listing the information or by providing a link and/or QR code that directs them to the information online.

### Flyers {.page-break-before}

Flyers can be used to convey important information about your competition to spectators and competitors, to answer some frequently asked questions that your local community might have, to alert competitions about future competitions in the area, and/or to direct competitors to online resources.

## Competitor Recognition

We highly recommend recognizing competitors’ achievements and work by giving awards, prizes, or honors. Achievements to qualify for awards, prizes, or honors include the following:

- Podium placements
- Achieving notable results
- Valuable volunteer contributions
- Best sum of ranks or Kinch ranks at the competition
- Fastest first-time competitor
- Participation

Competitors should attend the awards ceremony to receive awards, prizes, or honors. The awards ceremony should be held in the competition venue within one hour after the end of the last event. Organizers should inform winners of awards, prizes, or honors to be prepared to talk to journalists or any media covering the competition if applicable. Organization teams should have certificates for every category winner, signed by the Delegates and the leader of the organization team.

### Prizes

Prizes are a great way to recognize competitors’ achievements. Sponsors should be sought out to help provide prizes, if possible. Some examples of prizes include puzzles, gift cards, cash, trophies, or medals. Prizes can also include an object or item related to the competition name. For example, Potato Open 2018 offered potatoes to competitors who achieved a podium result.

### Certificates

Certificates are one of the least expensive ways to recognize competitors’ achievements but can leave competitors with something to remember. You should give competitors certificates even when you give prizes for the competition. You can find templates for certificates of volunteering, merit, and participation [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jrMWgOgNscPDqoxzgnEQ1bnV9D4FDzLj).

## Venue Layout

### Stanchions

Stanchions can be extremely useful for crowd control. Some ways that you can use stanchions are to prevent people from coming within 1.5 meters of solving stations while they are in use, to separate the competition area from non-competition areas, and to create a line for the registration table.

## For Fun

### Unofficial events

Holding events that are not recognized officially can be fun for competitors to participate in and spectators to watch. Some examples of unofficial events include team events, relays, and events with non-WCA puzzles. This can also help the WCA test how these unofficial events could work in official settings in the future.

### Goodies

Giving competitors “goodies” is a great way to enhance their competition experience. Suggestions of goodies that you could give to competitors can include drawstring bags, T-shirts, hoodies, hats, bracelets, stickers, pins, keychains, lanyards, magnets, badges, pens, pencils, phone accessories, sunglasses, and cube logos. Goodies can include branding related to the competition, an organization that held the competition, or competition sponsors.

## Volunteer Rewards and Incentives

You may incentivize competitors to join a dedicated volunteer team by providing them with free or discounted prices. This can include free or discounted registration fees, meals, apparel, or lodging. Volunteer incentives should be made known to the public before the day of competition for transparency and to enroll a higher number of volunteers.
