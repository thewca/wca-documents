# Running and Judging Systems

There are several different running systems you can choose for your competition. You should consider your region and listed Delegates for the competition when choosing your running system. This document will guide you through the most common running systems that are used all around the world.

Below are the three different roles regularly used at competitions. You can alter or mix them based on the competition.

## Runner

Runners are responsible for picking up puzzle covers with scrambled puzzles from the scrambling area, identifying the competitors (e.g. calling their name), dropping off the cover and puzzle at a vacant solving station.

Runners also look for judges signaling their attention (e.g. holding up the puzzle cover) to pick up covers with solved puzzles and take them back to the scrambling table. At the scrambling table, they then pick up more puzzle covers with scrambled puzzles and repeat the process.

During non-stationary rounds, runners also direct competitors to their solving stations. 

Numbering the stations can ease the runner’s job, regardless of whether the round is stationary or non-stationary. During non-stationary rounds, numbered stations allow runners to call a competitor to a specific station. During stationary rounds, the station numbers can be written on the scorecards to make it easier for runners to bring a puzzle to the correct station.

In general, runners do not sit down during the group they are running. They actively go between the competition area and scrambling table to return solved puzzles or to take scrambled puzzles to a solving station.

## Judge

### Seated/Fixed

Seated judges are judges who sit next to the solving station throughout the entire group or round. They do not call for competitors. They judge and signal to the runner when the attempt is done, typically by holding up a cover with the solved puzzle and score sheet.

In some regions, these are called “fixed judges” instead.

### Running

Running judges are judges who also do the job of a runner. They are responsible for judging and also picking up scrambled puzzles and calling for competitors before moving to a solving station that is available. This system of judges is most often used when there are not many available judges.

## Competitor

### Stationary

The competitor completes all of their attempts in one sitting. They do not need to go back to a waiting area between attempts. In some regions, this system is used exclusively. This system can also be used when the group is small enough (e.g. there are enough solving stations for the number of competitors in the group). Some competitions, especially championship competitions, use this system for only the final rounds of specific events.

### Non-stationary

The competitor goes back to a waiting area after every attempt until they complete all of their attempts in the round. This method can save time since it prevents a competitor from taking up a solving station while waiting for their puzzle to be correctly scrambled. This method can save a lot of time depending on the event, the region where the competition is taking place, and the scale of the competition.

## What Is The Best Way?

There is no single answer to this as this can vary a lot between regions and even competitions. In some regions, one way works better than the other.

Example: In some competitions in China, running judges are preferred, as competitors complete all their attempts in one sitting. Whereas in many parts of Europe, seated judges with runners are preferred, as competitors usually complete all their attempts non-stationary.

The running system might also change as the competition progresses (e.g. using seated judges with runners for first rounds and using running judges for final rounds where fewer competition volunteers might be available).

Many factors play into the system chosen for a competition such as a lack of volunteers, a lack of space for solving stations to have more chairs, and a lack of chairs. It is important to always listen to the advice from your Delegates on which system is the most suitable for your competition.
