This checklist serves as a tool to help guide you in the organization process and to give you a better understanding of it. You may edit a copy of the spreadsheet to suit your needs or the needs of organizers in your region, such as translating it into a local language.

::::: {.indent}
The **“Checklist”** tab lists the most important tasks you must do as an organizer to ensure your competition runs smoothly. The second column shows whether the step is necessary at every competition. Tick the cells in the third column as you finish the steps over time.

::::: {.indent}
The **“Equipment”** tab lists all the equipment you will need for the competition and everything you need to print. First, mark everything as necessary or “If needed” if those items apply to your competition. You can include the amount or quantity of each item in the “Amount” column. Mark the “Done” column as you get each item over time.

::::: {.indent}
The **“Expected budget”** tab is the expected budget for your competition. Please complete this form and send it to the Delegates before the competition. These can be estimates or actual values based on known prices. When using estimates for expenses, it is better to overestimate than underestimate.
:::::

::::: {.indent}
The **“Final budget”** tab is the actual budget for your competition. You will need to put the final values of each item **after** you make the payment as you go.
:::::

::::: {.indent}
The **“Volunteers”** tab is the list of volunteers who are helping you run the competition. “Volunteers” typically refers to people **not** listed as organizers or Delegates on the WCA competition page, but you may include them too. If there are no assigned volunteers, you may delete this tab.
