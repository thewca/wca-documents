You will need to download this spreadsheet and add details that are necessary for your specific competition if there are any additional ones.

::::: {.indent}
The **first** page is a to-do list that outlines the most important tasks you will need to do as an organizer in order to make sure your competition runs smoothly. The second column shows whether or not the step is necessary to do for all competitions. Tick the cells in the third column as you finish the steps over time.

The **second** page is the list of all equipment that you will need for the competition as well as all the things you will need to get printed. First make sure you have everything marked as necessary or “If needed”, in case those items are applicable to your competition. You may write down the necessary amount of everything. Tick the cells in the fourth column as you get all of the items over time.

::::: {.indent}
The **third** page is the expected budget for your competition. You will need to fill this out before the competition and send it to the Delegate(s). These can be estimates or actual values based on known prices. When using estimates for expenses it is better to overestimate than underestimate.

::::: {.indent}
The **fourth** page is the actual budget for your competition. You will need to put the final values of each item AFTER you make the payment as you go. This represents the factual final budget of your competition.

::::: {.indent}
The **fifth** and final page is the list of volunteers that are helping you run the competition. This typically refers to people that are NOT listed as organizers or Delegates on the WCA page of the competition, but you may write them down as well. If there are no assigned volunteers, you may delete this page.
