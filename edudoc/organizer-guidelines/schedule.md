# Scheduling a Competition

Creating a reasonable schedule is one of the most essential things for your competition to run properly. There are some key factors you must consider to make it accurate.

## Venue Details

These are unrelated to any specific event. However, you must consider all of these when creating your competition’s schedule.

1. How many days will the competition last?
2. What time can you arrive at the venue, and what time do you need to leave the venue?

Both of the above tell you how much time you have available to fill with the events you wish. Be aware that the events and the number of rounds you choose require Delegate approval. Before you start building the schedule, you should first discuss with the competition Delegates and reach an agreement on the events held and the number of rounds for each event. Remember that it will not always be possible to hold every event and round you initially intended.

You also need to ensure your competition ends with some buffer time before you must leave the venue, as any incident could delay the competition and cause unwanted trouble for everyone. Remember that you will still need to take down the competition setup and meet the venue’s cleaning requirements at the end of the day before you leave, so ensure you have enough time for that.

3. How much setting up is needed? For example, will you need to set up chairs for spectators, or does the venue have fixed seats?

If you are allowed to enter the venue starting at 8:00 AM, you cannot schedule the first event to start at 8:10 AM if it takes you half an hour to set up everything. The same logic applies at the end of the competition. If it takes you another 30 minutes for the takedown at the end of the day, you cannot make a schedule that ends 10 minutes before you leave the venue. This section of the schedule does not necessarily need to be publicly available, but as an organizer, you must take setting up and cleaning up into account when scheduling your competition.

You should also leave enough time at the beginning of your competition to check in every competitor. When you are allowing [on-the-spot registrations](wcadoc{edudoc/organizer-guidelines/registration.pdf}), you will also need to factor that in. Ensure the time scheduled for registering and checking in is appropriate based on the number of registered competitors (e.g. do not schedule only 10 minutes if you have over 100 competitors registered). You might have a large number of people arriving just before the main event if the main event is not the first event of the day, so ensure you consider the time and resources needed to register and/or check in those people.

4. How many solving stations will be available?

Knowing how many solving stations can be set up tells you how many people can compete at once. Remember that although more stations can shorten the duration of a round, they also require more judges, scramblers, and possibly runners, depending on the [running system](wcadoc{edudoc/organizer-guidelines/running-systems.pdf}) of your competition. You need to account for the additional time spent looking for volunteers if you do not [assign staff tasks beforehand](wcadoc{edudoc/organizer-guidelines/staff.pdf}).

5. What are the lunch options near the venue?

Remember that while some individuals travel by car to have lunch, other competitors and spectators might need to walk, meaning you need to consider the time it takes for one to walk to a restaurant and then back to the competition venue. Check that there is more than one food option in the area to prevent everyone from eating at the same place and to provide options for competitors with dietary restrictions.

Remember that some people might choose to bring food or order food delivery, especially when the lunch options are too far to walk to. Make it clear on the competition website whether the venue allows food to be brought inside.

If lunch is provided to competitors, ensure you schedule enough time for people to receive their food from the organizers and finish eating it before the competition starts again. If the only lunch option available is the one provided by the organization team, do your best to accommodate people with dietary restrictions, such as allowing them to request their preferred food in advance.

## Announcements, Tutorials, and Awards

Planned announcements aside from calling up competitors to compete need to be included on the schedule. Examples include a talk about the sponsors, some relevant information about the competition, competitor tutorials, and judging tutorials. The latter will usually be either at the start of the competition, just before the main event, or even both. Always be direct and do not make the announcements unnecessarily long, both to avoid taking up too much time and to improve competitors’ and spectators’ experience. Remember that many people would be annoyed by long, tedious talks. After all Final rounds have finished, you still need to account for the awards ceremony. If the competition is holding many events, the awards ceremony could add 15 or more minutes to your competition.

## Creating the Schedule

It is important to remember that just because another competition managed to hold a specific event in X time, it does not mean it is always possible for it to be done in that time. Here are some factors that affect how long a specific round takes:

- The number of competitors in the round
- The cutoffs and time limits of the round

These indicate how much time one person takes to complete their average, so having lower or higher cutoffs and time limits will extend or shorten the time it takes to hold a specific event.

- The average speed of the community in the event

If most people in your region can solve a 3x3x3 Cube in 12-30 seconds, it takes considerably less time to hold it than in a region where most people take 30-60 seconds to solve the cube. Most of the time, the average speed of first-time competitors will be unknown. If the region has a tendency to have a high number of first-time competitors, you should schedule some additional time for the most popular events as a safety measure.

- How much the community is familiar with the event

If Skewb is being held for the first time in the region in five years, the round will take longer due to inexperience and incidents than in a region that holds Skewb every month. If you hold an event infrequently, you should allocate **more** time for that round. If you hold an event frequently, you should allocate **less** time for that round.

- How much the community is familiar with competitions

This is similar to the previous point but is more general and will apply to every event. If you are holding the first competition ever in the region, you can be certain there will be lots of incidents due to inexperience with the competing procedure, scrambling will take longer, and more judges might need to be trained.

You also need to take the competitor experience into account, meaning you should avoid having two rounds of the same event in a row or sequential rounds of events that are too exhausting, especially at the end of the day (e.g. finishing a competition day with 3x3x3 Fewest Moves, 5x5x5 Blindfolded and 3x3x3 Multi-Blind in a row is a bad idea since people competing in all of them would have a negative experience that can be avoided by simply rearranging the schedule).

Once you have an initial draft of the schedule, you should work with the competition Delegates to refine the schedule and ensure it fits the local community. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Setting appropriate time cutoffs and time limits.
- Setting appropriate advancement conditions for subsequent rounds.
- Rearranging the schedule.
- Ensuring the schedule is neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic.

Always communicate with the Delegates when there are any changes you believe to be necessary or when you have information relevant to the schedule (e.g. a high number of expected first-time competitors). Ensure that both you and the Delegates know the progress of the schedule draft at all times to prevent anyone from losing time working on or trying to improve an inaccurate schedule. Ensure that between two rounds of the same event, you have enough time to enter the results of the previous round and for any preparation you might need (e.g. making groups for the next round).

## Simultaneous Events

Holding multiple events at the same time is an option you can choose, but it is not recommended when you do not have much experience with organizing competitions. Most of the time, a side room will be used to hold 3x3x3 Fewest Moves or a blindfolded event simultaneously to the main competition area. Although simultaneous events make it possible to hold more events in less time, it also requires a larger venue, more equipment, and more staff. Since there must be a Delegate overseeing every area where an official event is taking place, you need multiple Delegates if you are using separate rooms.

## Making Adjustments to the Schedule

After the registration period closes, you might have more or fewer registered competitors than you expected. If that’s the case, you can change the schedule to better accommodate the new expected number of competitors by adjusting cutoffs and time limits, adding or removing rounds, and changing the advancement requirements for subsequent rounds.

Remember you should discuss changes to the schedule with the co-organizers and Delegates. Also, you must notify all competitors in advance when you make changes to the schedule.

If you want to add or remove an event after the competition has been announced, you should request it as early as possible since it requires approval from the Delegates **and** from the WCA Competition Announcement Team. If you are uncertain about any possible changes or if anything unexpected comes up on the day of the competition, you should discuss it with the Delegates, as they can advise you on the best options for each scenario.
