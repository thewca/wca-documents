# Emails

This might not be applicable to everyone or every competition, but it can give competitors an idea of what to expect from the competition. A pre-competition email that acts as an information packet for competitors can be helpful, especially if you have a lot of new competitors.

Some benefits of sending this information packet include:

- New competitors having a better knowledge of what is expected of them.
- Parents/Guardians of new competitors feeling more comfortable with the new competitors staying at the competition by themselves.
- Parents/Guardians gaining a better understanding of what’s going on at the competition.
- Parents/Guardians and competitors being informed of the necessary information for the competition.

## What’s in it?

Here’s a list of things that can be useful to be in the information packet but are **not necessarily needed in every competition**.

- Reminder about groups/group information.
- Reminder to get in touch if dropping out to recoup on possible refund, subject to registrations terms and conditions.
- Reminder about competitor tutorials (if there are a lot of first-timers).
- Reminder for first-timers to bring identification (which will be checked during registration).
- A reminder of no flash photography.
- A link to live results.
- Parents/Guardians tend to worry about their child’s well being, so it’s important to help ease their worrying. Do try to answer their most common questions to the best of your knowledge in the email or direct them to someone (e.g. Delegate(s)) who can give a better answer.
- Which judging system will be used during the competition (Running judges/Seated judges with runners).
- Any special practices in the region which foreigners or newcomers might not be aware of.

::::: {.box .example}
Example: Using registration ID instead of initials for scrambling and judging signature, whether to check-in at the registration desk once a day or once across the whole competition, etc.
:::::

- Local amenities, cafe, food and drinks where guests and competitors can hang around while waiting for subsequent rounds.
- Parking at the venue and whether a pass is needed.
- An opportunity to mention the sponsors.
- Leave your contact details so people can email, call, or message you if they’re struggling to get to the venue.
- Any final updates/changes. **Maybe a revised schedule if fewer competitors registered than expected.**

::::: {.box .important}
It is highly advisable that you share your email draft with the Delegate(s) and the organization team before sending it off to all competitors.

## Multiple Languages

If English isn’t widely spoken in the region of the competition, you should consider adapting the important key points into the local language as well before sending out the pre-competition email. On some occasions, you might have to send the pre-competition email in more than one language. It is recommended that if you do not speak one of the local languages, you should find someone who can work with you on it. Depending on where you are, you may need to include languages from neighboring countries too.

Below is more information in regard to general emails, not necessarily in regard to the larger, last minute information email.

## General Email Structure

As an organizer, you will almost certainly have to use email in some way for your competition. Having a good structure for your emails can make messages look a lot more professional for you and the WCA.

### Subject

The subject of the email should be **straightforward and simple**. <span style="color:red">Avoid long sentences</span>. Always include the name of the competition in the subject, this lets the recipients know straight away what the email is about. This is especially important when communicating with Delegate(s) as they might have a number of competitions coming up. **Some examples: “Important Information about XX Open 2020”, “XX Open 2020”, “XX Open 2020 groups” etc.**

### Greetings

Your greetings can elevate the outlook of the email itself. It makes it look more professional and friendly, especially if the primary language of communication is English. If emailing numerous competitors at the same time, try using “Hi all,” “Dear competitors,” or “Good afternoon” at the beginning of your email.
If emailing individuals, then try to include their name. **“Hi Jonas,” “Dear Martha,” etc.**

Besides a good opening, you’ll want the email to end in a similar manner. The common practice is to close an email with your name and a variation of “**Regards**” above it.

**Example:**

::::: {.box .example .text-left}
Kind Regards

_Your Name_
:::::

Some variations like “Best Regards,” “Kind Regards,” “See you soon,” or “Thanks” are also acceptable if used appropriately.

### CC or BCC

::::: {.box .important}
When handling group emails, you should always send it out as a **BCC** instead of a _CC_ for privacy reasons.
:::::

However, **CC** is more applicable when handling communications emails between **organizers and Delegate(s)**.

Always include both organizers and Delegate(s) in the CC list for any changes to the competition or any communication with competitors. **Example: Competitor dropping out, change of events or asking for travel advice.** This way, everyone in the organization team and the Delegate(s) are aware of what's going on during the competition.

### Body

The body is the message you want to convey. <span style="color:red">Avoid using very long sentences without punctuation. Avoid using all caps, all bold or all underline.</span> **Bold**, <u>underline</u> and _italics_ are mainly used to make certain words or sentences stand out. This is usually to emphasize the important keywords of a sentence or key sentences in a paragraph.

Stick to the subject. If the subject is about groups, then the groups must be mentioned. Some additional relevant information can be communicated through the same email. **Use the hyperlink function** whenever you’re linking information from a website. This way the recipients don’t have to google and click through multiple web pages to find the information you’re talking about. This also limits the chance that they go on the wrong website and find the wrong information.
**Example: Recipients might find information on “XX Open 2019” and mistaken it as “XX Open 2020”.**

#### Example Email

::::: {.box .example .text-left}
Subject: Important Information about XX Open 2020

Hello competitor,

Thank you for registering to compete in XX Open 2020. Unfortunately, we did not reach the number registrations in 3x3 necessary to have a 4th round. This means we will not be running the 4th round of 3x3 and the semifinal will now be final instead. The updated schedule can be found here[add link to new schedule].

Kind Regards

_Your Name_

Organization Team of XX Open 2020
