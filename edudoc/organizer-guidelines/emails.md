# Emails

## General Email Structure

As an organizer, you will almost certainly need to use email in some way for your competition. A good email structure will make messages look more professional for you and the WCA.

### Subject

The subject of the email should be straightforward. **Avoid long sentences**. Always include the competition name in the subject to let the recipients know what the email is about. The subject is essential when communicating with Delegates since they might have several upcoming competitions.

Here are some examples of subjects. Replace “XX Open 2025” with the actual name of a competition.

- “Important Information about XX Open 2025”
- “XX Open 2025”
- “XX Open 2025 groups”

### Greeting

Your greeting should be the first line of the email. A greeting makes the email look more professional and friendly, especially when the primary language of communication is English. If you are sending an email to several competitors, consider the following greetings:

- Hi all,
- Dear competitors,
- Good afternoon,

If you are sending an email to a person, consider including their name in the greeting, like the following:

- Hi Jonas,
- Hello Martha,

### CC or BCC

::::: {.box .important}
For privacy reasons, when emailing multiple competitors, you must add them to the **Blind Carbon Copy** (BCC) field instead of the _Carbon Copy_ (CC) field.
:::::

Use the **CC** field when communicating with **organizers and Delegates**.

::::: {.box .important}
Always add co-organizers and Delegates to the CC field when responding to a competitor’s email.
:::::

Every organizer and Delegate should be aware of all communication from competitors, such as competitors withdrawing from the competition, changing their events, or asking for travel advice.

### Body

The body is the message you want to convey. <span style="color:red">Avoid using long sentences without punctuation, and avoid writing using all uppercase letters, all bold, or all underlined.</span> You should only use **bolding**, <u>underlining</u>, or _italicizing_ to emphasize the important keywords in a sentence or key sentences in a paragraph.

Stick to the subject. For example, if the subject mentions groups, you should talk about groups in the email. You can also communicate additional relevant information. **Use the hyperlink feature** whenever you are linking information from a website. Hyperlinks will prevent the recipients from wasting time searching for the webpage or landing on the wrong one. For example, recipients might find information on “XX Open 2024” and mistake it as “XX Open 2025”.

### Sign-off

Your email should end in the same tone that it started with. It should end with a sign-off such as the following:

- Regards,
- Thanks,
- Sincerely,
- Cheers,
- See you soon,

**Example:**

::::: {.box .example .text-left}
Kind Regards,

_Your Name_
:::::

### Example email

::::: {.box .example .text-left}
Subject: Important Information about XX Open 2020

Hello competitor,

Thank you for registering to compete in XX Open 2020. Unfortunately, we did not reach the number of registrations in 3x3x3 Cube necessary for a fourth round. The third round will be the final round instead. You can find the updated schedule here[add the link to the new schedule].

Kind Regards,

_Your Name_

Organization Team of XX Open 2020

## Pre-Competition Email

A pre-competition email that acts as an information packet for competitors can give competitors an idea of what to expect from the competitors, especially when you have a lot of first-time competitors.

Some benefits of sending this information packet include:

- First-time competitors gain an understanding of how the competition will run.
- Parents/guardians gain an understanding of how a competition will run.
- Parents/guardians of young competitors feel more comfortable allowing their competitors to stay at the competition venue by themselves.

Here is some information that you can consider including in an information packet:

- How do groups work? How can competitors find their group information?
- Which judging system will be used?
- What should they do if they can no longer attend the competition?
- Will there be a first-time competitor tutorial?
- Should first-time competitors bring identification?
- What should parents/guardians filming competitors be mindful of?
- Where do competitors find their live results?
- Are there any special practices that are unique to this region?

::::: {.box .example} Example: Using registration ID instead of initials for scrambling and judging signature, whether to check in at the registration desk once a day or once across the whole competition.
:::::

- Has the schedule been recently revised?
- Who are the sponsors?
- Where can guests and competitors go while they are waiting for their group?
- What is the parking situation at the venue?
- What is your contact information in case someone struggles to find the venue?

::::: {.box .important} It is highly recommended that you share your email draft with the Delegates and the organization team before sending it to all competitors.
:::::

Parents/guardians tend to worry about their children’s well-being, so it is essential to help ease their worrying. Answer their most common questions in the email to the best of your knowledge or direct them to someone (e.g. a Delegate) who can provide a better answer.

## Multiple Languages

Suppose English is not widely spoken in the competition’s region. In that case, you should consider translating the essential points in the pre-competition email into the local language. Sometimes, you might need to send the entire pre-competition email in multiple languages. You should find someone else to write it if you do not speak one of the local languages. Depending on where you are, you might need to also include languages from neighboring countries.
