# Organizer Work During the Competition

As an organizer, it is important that you stay up to date with the planning and stay in communication with your Delegates and co-organizers.

The tasks you will need to do vary from region to region, but in general, there are several points below that your Delegate will likely expect you to perform. If you have any specific questions, please ask the Delegate you are planning on working with. Upon discussion, they might help you in some areas or advise you on how to do them.

## Preparing the Venue

You must have the venue set up before the competition begins. This might take a significant amount of time, so allocate a sufficient amount of time for it. This includes moving the tables and chairs and setting up the equipment.

You might also need to modify the setup from one event to the next. For example, you might set aside regular puzzle covers and bring out special covers for Clock. Another example is placing papers and stopwatches out on a side stage for Fewest Moves.

## Registration and Check-in

You need someone at the registration table while competitors are showing up. This is an important yet often overlooked role. If you are the main organizer, you are likely busy in the morning with sorting out other things. You should ask an experienced Community Member in advance whether they would be willing to help you with this. If the organization team consists of more than just yourself, you may assign someone who is not one of the main members responsible for running the competition to do this task.

You should also consider your schedule, as it is likely that not everyone will show up in the morning if you have placed 3x3x3 Cube or another popular event later in the day.

If you do not have many volunteers, consider using the same table for score-taking to always have a person to greet the competitors.

The person in charge of checking in people should also ensure that citizenships and the date of birth of competitors are checked and match the registration data.

More information on the setup is in the [Venue Setup document](wcadoc{edudoc/organizer-guidelines/venue-setup.pdf}).

## Score-Taking

You must have someone to enter the results throughout the competition. This does not need to be the same person for the entire competition, but it is often the same few people. If you are the main organizer, this is not something to always assign to yourself, as you will be busy with other tasks and overlooking the competition if concerns arise. If your organization team is large, you should assign someone who is not the main organizer.

Results should be entered in a timely and accurate manner for competitors who are eager to see how they ranked and to ensure enough time to prepare score sheets for subsequent rounds at the competition. If the results are not entered in a timely manner, it might delay the start of a subsequent round due to not having ample time to prepare the score sheets for subsequent rounds.

You should have someone other than the designated score taker double-check the results so they can be submitted at the end of the competition. Otherwise, the Delegates will spend hours double-checking the results after the competition. Double-checking throughout the day is better than doing it after the competition since it prevents significant score-taking mistakes that cause the wrong competitors to proceed to subsequent rounds or receive awards.

The score taker needs to be instructed on how extra attempts are written. They should also look out for missing competitor signatures or judge signatures on individual attempts. The score taker should also look out for a Delegate signatures on extra attempts to ensure the extra attempt was authorized.

## Managing the Venue

The organizer in charge of the venue, likely the main organizer, will be asked a lot of questions throughout the day from competitors, parents/guardians, and spectators about the venue (e.g. the location of the restrooms). They should ensure there are enough chairs and tables for everyone. If they are in charge of keys and ensuring people have access to places in the venue. They are responsible for resolving any venue-related issues that arise and might need to contact the venue owner.

## Calling Volunteers

One of the tasks for the organizers is calling volunteers (i.e. scramblers, judges, and possibly runners) for each group and ensuring the group proceeds according to plan. The organizers need to check that solving stations have judges, scrambling tables have reliable scramblers, and stages have runners if needed. If you are assigning duties, you could print out an overview of who is scrambling, judging, and running for each group so you can quickly find them during the competition. If someone who is assigned to judge, scramble, or run refuses to fulfill their task or is missing, notify your Delegates.

## Calling Groups

As a group is finishing up, you should start preparing for the next group. This includes placing the next group of score sheets at the drop-off table. When the previous group has finished, you need to announce that the next group is now starting. If you do not have a microphone available, make the announcement using a loud voice if needed. Starting the new group also includes getting the volunteers in place, as mentioned in the previous section. Lastly, the Delegate will need to provide access to the next scramble set for the next group.
