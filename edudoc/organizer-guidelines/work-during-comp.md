# Organizer work during the competition

As an organizer of a competition, it is very important that you keep on top of the planning and stay communicative with your Delegate(s) and co-organizers.

The tasks you will have to do vary from region to region, but in general, there are several points below which your Delegate will likely expect you to perform. If you have any specific questions, please ask the Delegate you are planning on working with. Upon discussion, they might help you in some areas or advise you on how to do them.

## Preparing the venue

You need to make sure to have the venue set up so it is ready for the competition. This may take a significant amount of time, so be sure to set off the required amount of time needed for it. This includes having all the tables and chairs laid out and also all the needed equipment.

You might also need to modify the setup from one event to the next. This might include setting the regular cube covers off to the side and preparing your special ones for Clock if you have them. This can also be placing papers and stopwatches out on a side stage in time for Fewest Moves as that can take some time.

## Registration/Check-in

You need someone at the registration table when many people are showing up. This is a very critical point and often overlooked. If you are the main organizer, you are likely busy in the morning with sorting out other things. You should ask an experienced community member in advance if they would be willing to help you with this. If you have an organization team that consists of more than just yourself, you can assign someone who is not one of the main members responsible for running the competition to do this task.

You should also consider your schedule, as it is likely that not everyone will show up in the morning if you have placed 3x3 or another popular event later on the day.

If you are lacking personnel to help, it might be beneficial to also have the registration table the same place as where score taking is done so there will always be a person to greet the competitors.

The person in charge of checking people in should also make sure that citizenships and the date of birth of competitors are checked and match the registration data.

More on the setup can be found in the [Venue Setup document](wcadoc{edudoc/organizer-guidelines/venue-setup.pdf}).

## Score-taking

You will need someone who is actively entering the results during the competition. This does not need to be the same person the entire competition, but often it will be the same 1-3 people. If you are the main organizer, this is not something to assign to yourself all the time as you will be busy with other tasks and overlooking the competition if concerns arise. If you have a larger organization team, this is a good task to assign someone who is not the main organizer as this is a very necessary role.

Results should be typed in quickly as competitors are likely very eager to see where they placed, but accuracy must never be neglected too.
It is also very important to have results typed in quickly if you are preparing scorecards for subsequent rounds at your competition. This is to make sure a bottleneck is not caused by having to wait around for printing second round scorecards just before the start of the round.

Your Delegate(s) will be very appreciative if you can, in addition to having a designated score-taker, also have some else double-check the results so they can be submitted at the end of the competition and the Delegate(s) will not have to spend hours on their own dealing with the results. This is also a good practice to do throughout the day to make sure there are not any major mistakes causing wrong competitors to proceed to subsequent rounds.

The score-taker also needs to be instructed about how extra attempts are written in and to look out for a Delegate signature on the extra attempt to make sure it is authorized. They should also be looking out for missing signatures for individual attempts by both the competitor and judge.

## Dealing with the venue

The person in charge of the venue, likely the main organizer, will be asked a lot of questions throughout the day from competitors, parents, and spectators about where different things are in the venue (e.g. toilets). Another item they might need to address is making sure there are enough chairs and tables set out for competitors. This person is likely also in charge of keys and making sure people can get to the, potentially locked, places they need to access.
Depending on who the owner is, or if issues arise, someone needs to be responsible for talking to the venue owner and resolve the issues.

## Calling Volunteers

One of the tasks for the organizers is calling volunteers (scramblers, judges, and possibly runners) for each group and making sure the group proceeds according to plan. The organizers need to always check if all the needed judging stations have judges. They also need to pay attention to whether all scramblers are in place and, if in use, the needed number of runners is present. If you are assigning duties, you can print out an overview of who is scrambling/judging/running for each group so you can quickly find them during the competition. If someone who is assigned to judge or scramble refuses to fulfill their task or is missing, notify your Delegate(s) of this and they will handle the case.

## Calling groups

As the previous group is finishing up, you should start preparing for the next one. This includes placing all the scorecards of the group out in the cube drop off area. When the previous group has finished, you need to notify the people that the next group is now starting. Preferably you should have a microphone available, otherwise, you need to be prepared to be loud depending on the size of the competition. Starting the new group also includes getting the volunteers in place as mentioned in the above section. Last but not least, you should generally coordinate this process with the Delegate, as they need to provide access to the new scramble set for a new group.
