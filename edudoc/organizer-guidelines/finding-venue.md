# Finding a venue

There are many ways to find a venue, and if a venue fits the needs of a cubing competition well, it might even become a regular venue for your area in the future!

Before looking for a venue, make sure you’ve read through other documents in the guidelines, such as the Venue Setup, as it will give you a better understanding of the actual size of the space when the equipment and setup are factored in.

Depending on where you are, it may be worth pursuing local schools/universities. Especially if you or someone on the organization team attends the school, these are usually really good venues to use as they tend to charge less for their students and can possibly promote beneficial activities in the school.
Some options to consider if you do not have access to a school/university venue:

- Local community centers
- Art theaters
- Sports halls
- Hotel function rooms
- Shopping malls

You can usually find a range of venues through a search on Google. **[Name of city/town/district] venue hire/rental** is usually a good place to start.

**It isn’t the end of the world if you don’t have answers to all the questions below yet.** You’ll be able to iron out a lot of the details down the road through essential communications between yourself, Delegate(s), and the venue. **It is important that you remain proactive during this process and not leave queries unanswered until the last minute.** If you’re a minor, please try to get your parents/guardians on board to help co-organize the event. Either way, it is ideal to have someone who could share the workload, so having a co-organizer(s) is always recommended.

Additional help/assistance might be available if there’s a [regional organisation acknowledged by the WCA](wca{organizations}) that covers the area. Be sure to verify legal requirements directly with the venue, as signing a contract may be needed to rent it. Some venues might need a public liability insurance. You should double check with a local delegate if there’s one in place or if you have to purchase one. In general, an insurance cover will always do more good than harm so you should consider it if it is a feasible option to pursue.

## Competition date(s)

Ideally you should have a rough set of dates in mind that suits you, the venue, and a local WCA Delegate. Once you find a venue that is appropriate for the competition you’re intending to organize and is available, you should get in touch with a WCA Delegate(s) to decide on a specific/rough date(s).

You must also follow the requirements set out in the [WCA Competition Requirement Policy](wcadoc{documents/policies/external/Competition%20Requirements.pdf}). You must make sure the dates are realistic that the competition can without great time pressure be announced at least 28 days in advance of the competition. You should also allow enough time for competitors to complete their registration and to plan their trip.

Please also double check with the local community/delegate(s) to avoid breaking the proximity policy stated in the WCA Competition Requirement Policy.

## Venue fees

You should find out how much it is to rent the venue and keep the Delegate(s) updated with the price. You should also double check with the venue for any additional fees such as renting the projector, sound systems and etc. Competitions may sometimes incurred additional fees to enter the venue, such as if the competition is part of a festival/convention. The Delegate(s) should be able to advise whether the competition is feasible. It might also be worth mentioning to the venue that the event is a non-profit/community group activity as some venues do provide a lower fee for such events. **Keep in mind that you may not use the WCA's non-profit status as a selling point for receiving a lower rent price during your negotiations!**

## Preliminary visit

::::: {.box .important}
Ideally, you would want to pick a venue that you can visit in person. If possible, it also helps to have multiple options that you can compare.

## Venue size

The venue size must accommodate the intended and appropriate competitor limit.
Consider the following points when determining the competitor limit:

- The number of spectators.
- Space for competitors’ area, solving area and staff area.
- If a sponsor/retailer is opening a stall, is there enough space?
- Is the competitor limit a reflection of the density and activeness of the local community?
- How many competitors are you expecting? Does the event set appeal to a different audience than other competitions?
- Can you ensure enough space for flow of Competitors, Runners and Judges in the solving area?

Take photos and videos if you can while you’re viewing the venue. Sometimes the advertised size of the venue might not necessarily reflect on the available space and **the room limit should never be the competitor limit.** Venues set their limit according to how many people can be squeezed in the room with limited movement which does not fit for competitions. The person limit given by the venue can often be divided by two or three and should give you an estimate of the possible competitor limit. An ideal amount of space is around 3 sqm per person, you could also divide the venue size by 3 to find out the upper limit for the competitor limit. Having photos and videos would also help you plan your setup in advance before the competition.

## Venue location

In most cases, the venue should be in a location that is accessible to all competitors. Ideally, the venue should be within 20 minutes walk of public transport. However, depending on where you are, public transport might not be as relevant as different regions might prefer other modes of transportation. Competitions may be held in remote areas sometimes to serve local communities who are far from major cities.
Ask yourself: How will competitors get to the venue?

- If they’re driving, are there enough parking spaces around?
- If they’re getting there through public transport, how easy is it to get there?
- If the competition is more than one day, is there any accommodation nearby?
- Are there any places nearby that competitors could get food and drinks?
- Is the venue accessible for people with disabilities?

## Venue facilities

Some questions to consider for the venue are:

- Who is providing the chairs and tables? Do they have enough of them for the competition?
- Is Wi-Fi or a reliable cellular connection available for score-taking?
- Are the power sockets in a good spot/if you will need an extension?
- Does the venue have restrooms?
- Does the venue have food or drink available nearby?
- Who will cover cleaning? Is this included in the cost?
- Is there a side room that can be used for simultaneous events or as an extra guest area?
- Is the temperature inside the venue suitable (not too cold and not too hot)?
- Prefer white lighting/daylight and avoid venues with yellow-ish lighting.

## What comes after?

On some occasions, you’ll need to maintain frequent communication with the venue. This will help to ensure that the event details are clear between both parties. Always try to update the venue if there’s a change in your venue set up, you need additional facilities, etc. On some occasions, you could even send in a sketch of the tables and chairs layout so they could set it up for you before/on the day of competition.
