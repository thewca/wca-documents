# Finding a Venue

There are many ways to find a venue. If a venue fits the needs of a cubing competition well, it might become a regular venue for your area.

Before looking for a venue, ensure you have read through other documents in the guidelines, such as the [Venue Setup](wcadoc{edudoc/organizer-guidelines/venye-setup.pdf}) document, as it will give you a better understanding of the actual size of the space when the equipment and setup are factored in.

Depending on where you are, it could be worth pursuing local schools or universities. Especially if you or someone on the organization team attends the school, these are usually really good venues to use, as they tend to charge less for their students and could promote beneficial activities in the school.

Here are some options to consider when you do not have access to a school or university venue:

- Local community centers
- Art theaters
- Sports halls
- Hotel function rooms
- Shopping malls

You can usually find a range of venues through a Google search. **“[Name of city/town/district] venue hire/rental”** should be a good place to start.

**It is okay if you do not have answers to all the questions below yet.** You can settle the details throughout the organization process through essential communications between yourself, Delegates, and the venue. **It is important that you remain proactive during this process and not leave questions unanswered until the very end.** If you are a minor, please try to get your parents/guardians on board to help co-organize the event. Either way, it is ideal to have someone who can share the workload, so having a co-organizer is always recommended.

Additional help might be available if there is a [Regional Organization acknowledged by the WCA](wca{organizations}) that covers the area. Ensure you verify legal requirements directly with the venue, as you might need to sign a contract to rent it. Some venues might require liability insurance coverage. You should double-check with a local Delegate whether liability insurance is provided or whether you need to purchase it separately. In general, liability insurance coverage will always do more good than harm, so you should determine whether you should pursue it.

## Competition Dates

You should know a rough set of dates that suits you, the venue, and a local Delegate. Once you find an available venue that is appropriate for the competition you intend to organize, you should contact a Delegate to decide on a specific or rough date.

You must also follow the requirements set out in the [WCA Competition Requirement Policy](wcadoc{documents/policies/external/Competition%20Requirements.pdf}). You must ensure the dates are realistic so that the competition can be announced at least 28 days before the competition day without putting too much time pressure on the WCA Competition Announcements Team (WCAT). You should also allow enough time for competitors to complete their registration and plan their trip.

Please also double-check with the local community and Delegates to avoid breaking the proximity policy stated in the WCA Competition Requirement Policy.

## Venue Fees

You should find out how much it is to rent the venue. Keep the Delegates updated with the price. You should also double-check with the venue for any additional fees, such as for renting a projector or sound system. Competitions can sometimes incur additional fees to enter the venue, such as when the competition is part of a festival or convention. The Delegates should be able to advise whether the competition is feasible. It might also be worth mentioning to the venue that the event is a non-profit or community group activity, as some venues do provide a lower fee for such events. **Remember that you must not use the WCA’s non-profit status as a selling point for receiving a lower rent price during your negotiations!**

## Preliminary Visit

Ideally, you would want to pick a venue that you can visit in person. If possible, it also helps to have multiple options that you can compare them.

## Venue Size

The venue size must accommodate the intended and appropriate competitor limit.

Consider the following points when determining the competitor limit:

- The density and activeness of the local community
- The expected number of competitors
- The selection of events and whether they appeal to spectators
- The number of spectators
- The space for the competition area, spectator area, and volunteer area
- The space for the flow of competitors, runners, and judges in the competition area
- The space for a sponsor or retailer if they are running a booth at the competition

Take photos and videos if you can while you are viewing the venue. The advertised size of the venue might not necessarily reflect the available space, and **the room limit should never be the competitor limit.** Remember that venues set their limits according to how many people can be squeezed into the room with limited movement. The limit given by the venue can often be divided by two or three and should give you an estimate of the possible competitor limit. An ideal amount of space is approximately 3 meters squared per person. You can also divide the venue size by 3 to find out the upper limit for the competitor limit. Having photos and videos of the venue would also help you plan your setup before the competition.

## Venue Location

Ideally, the venue should be within a 20-minute walk of the nearest public transportation. However, depending on where you are, public transportation might not be as relevant as different regions might prefer other modes of transportation. Competitions can sometimes be held in remote areas to serve local communities far from major cities.

Ask yourself: How will competitors get to the venue?

- If they are driving, are there enough parking spots around?
- If they are getting there by public transportation, how easy is it to get there?
- If the competition is more than one day, is there any lodging nearby?
- Are there any places nearby where competitors can get food and drinks?
- Is the venue accessible for people with disabilities?

## Venue Facilities

Some questions to consider for the venue are:

- Who is providing the chairs and tables? Do they have enough of them for the competition?
- Is Wi-Fi or a reliable cellular connection available for score-taking?
- Are the power sockets in a good spot? If not, will you need an extension cord?
- Does the venue have restrooms?
- Does the venue have food or drink available nearby?
- Who will cover cleaning? Is this included in the venue cost?
- Is there a side room that can be used for simultaneous events or as an additional guest area?
- Is the temperature inside the venue suitable? Or is it too cold or too hot?
- Does the venue have bright, white lighting, or is it too dark or yellowish?

## What Comes Next?

On some occasions, you will need to maintain frequent communication with the venue. This will help to ensure the event details are clear between both parties. Always try to update the venue if there is a change in your venue setup or if you need additional facilities. Some venues allow you to send in a sketch of the layout of the tables and chairs so they can set it up for you before the competition.
