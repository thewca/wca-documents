# Creating Your Organization Team

Organization teams should consist of more than one person whenever possible. The size of your competition will influence how many people are necessary to run and organize a successful competition. Here are four options for people whom you should reach out to for help:

- A friend who is also interested in organizing
- Someone who has organized competitions before
- Your Regional Organization, if there is one
- A Delegate who can help you organize the competition directly or suggest someone else who could help

The exact timing of when to contact other people to join your organization team depends on many factors. The two most important factors are the current frequency of competitions in the region and whether you already have a suitable venue.

If you already have a venue, start contacting people to help you organize the competition. If you do not know a venue yet, you should likely not be reaching out to a Delegate to ensure you are not wasting their time with an idea that has no starting point. However, just showing your interest to other, more experienced people is a good thing. It might motivate them to organize another competition with you.

Once you have formed an organization team, you should choose a main organizer. The main organizer will be the person who has all of the important information regarding the organization of the competition. They should have good leadership skills since they will be assigning duties to other organizers and volunteers throughout the competition.

## Contacting a Delegate

The complete list of all WCA Delegates can be found [here](wca{Delegates}). You should prioritize choosing a Delegate who lives close to the competition venue. If there is already a Delegate in your region or a nearby region, you should reach out to them. If the local Delegate is unavailable for the competition, they should provide you with appropriate next steps or another Delegate who could help. If they are unable to help you, contact the Senior Delegate of the region.

If there is no Delegate in your region, you may reach out to your Senior Delegate so that they can try to help you find a Delegate to make your competition official.

The process of finding an available Delegate and a suitable date could take a few weeks or even a month. Since competitions must be announced at least 28 days before the competition date, you should start contacting a Delegate at least two months in advance to safely ensure the competition can be announced in time. If there are many competitions in your region, ensure you reach out further in advance to ensure there is room in the regional schedule for your competition.

Please remember that a Delegate has the authority to reject your competition for various reasons. This can include your current level of experience, the current frequency of competitions in the region, or their own availability.

The best time to contact a Delegate is when you have an organization team and a suitable venue. If you do not yet have an organization team but you have a venue, contacting a Delegate is still a good idea since they can likely help you find the appropriate people and advise you whether you need more organizers on the organization team.
