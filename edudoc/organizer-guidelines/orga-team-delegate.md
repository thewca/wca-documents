# Creating your organization team

It is highly recommended to have an organization team consisting of more than one person. The size of the competition you are holding will influence how many people will be necessary to run and organize the competition well. Here are four options for people whom you should reach out to for help:

- A friend who is also interested in organizing.
- Someone who has organized competitions before.
- Your regional cubing organization, if there is one.
- A Delegate who might help you in organizing the competition directly or suggest someone who might be able to help.

The exact timing of when to contact other people to join your organization team may depend on many factors. The two most important factors are the current amount of competitions in the region and if you already have a suitable venue which could be used.

If you already have a venue, this is a good time to contact people to help you organize the competition. If you do not have a venue in mind yet, you should likely not be reaching out to a Delegate to make sure you are not wasting their time with an idea that has no starting point. However, just showing your interest to other more experienced people is a good thing as it might motivate them to organize another competition with you as they could have more help available.

Once you have assembled an organization team, you should choose a main organizer. The main organizer will be the person, who has all of the important information regarding the organization of the competition. They should have good leadership skills, as many tasks will need to be delegated to other organizers or volunteers throughout the competition.

## Contacting a Delegate

The complete list of all WCA Delegates can be found [here](wca{delegates}). It is important for you to find the most appropriate for you depending on the location of the competition. If there is already a Delegate in your nearby region, you should begin by reaching out to them. If the local Delegate is not available for the competition, they will likely point you to the appropriate next steps or another Delegate who could help, otherwise, contact the Senior Delegate of the region.

Unfortunately, there might not be a Delegate in your region. In that case, reaching out to the Senior Delegate of the region is the most appropriate solution so that they can try to help you find a Delegate to make your competition official.

Be aware that the process of finding an available Delegate and a suitable date may take a few weeks or even a month, and since competitions must be announced at least 28 days before the competition date, you should start contacting a Delegate at least two months in advance to safely ensure the competition can be announced in time. If there are many competitions in your region, make sure to reach out further in advance to ensure there is room in the regional schedule for your competition.

Please keep in mind that a Delegate has the authority to reject your competition for various reasons. This may include your current level of experience, the current amount of competitions in the region, or their own availability.

If you have an organization team and a suitable venue, this is the best time to contact a Delegate as there is a great starting point.

If you do not yet have an organization team but you have a venue, contacting a Delegate is still a good idea since they can likely help you with finding the appropriate people and advise you if you need more members of the organization team.
