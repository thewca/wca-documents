# Reflection


This is a guide to help organizers reflect on their competitions in order to improve the quality of future competitions.


## Recognizing Strengths:

If you notice anything is running exceptionally well then be sure to take notes so that you can attempt to replicate it in the future. Be sure to note all the variables that you think may be applicable, this can include equipment in use, specific people fulfilling staffing roles, systems in use, competition layout, group organization, etc.


## Identifying Shortcomings:

Being able to identify shortcomings is extremely important if you want to improve your competitions! Throughout your competitions be sure to be asking yourself these questions: Is there anything preventing us from running the competition more efficiently? Is there anything detracting from the enjoyment of competitors, staff, spectators, or Delegates? If you answer yes to these questions then take note of exactly what is happening (Note: you don’t necessarily need to come up with solutions or improvements on the spot, you can always come up with solutions in the time after your competition).


## Getting feedback:

There are lots of groups you can get feedback from so make sure to ask! Competitors, staff, the organization team, and the Delegate(s) are all good groups of people to ask. Receiving feedback can assist you in gaining a better understanding of how your competition ran.

### Competitors:

There are a few ways to receive feedback from competitors, we recommend surveying the competitors at the competition or online. Here is an [Example survey](https://forms.gle/tKNCW1xdVaCXSzG97) to give you some ideas for what information may be useful to ask of competitors. Another method can be to make social media posts, especially if you have some sort of forum or group specific to the region the competition was held in.

### Staff:

If you have any dedicated staff then it can be really helpful to receive their feedback after the competition! Be sure to ask questions to figure out if there was anything inhibiting staff from fulfilling their duties as efficiently as possible.

### Delegate(s) and other members of the organization team:

One of the best ways to achieve feedback from the Delegate(s) and the other members of the organization team is to hold a post-competition discussion, this can be done in person or online. Dinners after the competition, online calls, or messaging each other online are some good ways to do this. These discussions should recognize strengths, identify shortcomings, and discuss things that could be done differently at future competitions to improve them.

### Other:

Improving the experience of others such as parents/guardians, spectators, vendors, and venue staff is important too! Reaching out to them to ask how your organization could improve their experience at future competitions is a great thing to do.

Here are some questions that you should try to get an answer to:

- Were there any issues preventing staff from fulfilling their staffing assignments to the best of their abilities? How can you reduce the effects of these issues?
- Was there anything that caused the competition to run less efficiently than it could have run?
- Was there anything detracting from the enjoyment of competitors, staff, spectators, or Delegates?
- Were there any common incidents? If so are there any changes that can be made to reduce the frequency of the incidents?
- Were there any staff or competitors who caused repeated problems?
- What things that were tried out for the first time did or didn’t work? What caused them to fail or succeed?
- Were there any issues with first-time competitors? Can we prevent that issue at future competitions?
- What changes will be made for the next competition organized?
