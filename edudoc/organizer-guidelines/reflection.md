# Reflection

This is a guide to help organizers reflect on their past competitions to improve the quality of their future competitions.

## Recognizing Strengths

If you notice anything is running exceptionally well, ensure you take notes so that you can try to replicate it in the future. Ensure you note every variable that you think could be applicable, including equipment in use, specific people fulfilling volunteer duties, systems in use, competition layout, or group organization.

## Identifying Shortcomings

It is important to identify your shortcomings if you want to improve your competitions. Ensure you ask yourself these questions throughout your competitions:

- Is there anything preventing us from running the competition more efficiently?
- Is there anything detracting from the enjoyment of competitors, volunteers, spectators, or Delegates?

If you answer yes to these questions, take note of exactly what is happening. You do not necessarily need to come up with solutions or improvements on the spot. You can come up with solutions in the time after your competition.

## Getting Feedback

There are lots of individuals you can get feedback from, so ensure you ask! Competitors, volunteers, the organization team, and the Delegates are good people to ask. Receiving feedback can assist you in gaining a better understanding of how your competition ran.

### Competitors

There are a few ways to receive feedback from competitors. We recommend surveying the competitors at the competition or online. Here is an [example survey](https://forms.gle/tKNCW1xdVaCXSzG97) to give you some ideas for what information could be useful to ask of competitors. Another method is making social media posts, especially if you have some sort of forum or group specific to the region where the competition was held.

### Volunteers

If you have any dedicated competition volunteers, it can be helpful to receive their feedback after the competition! Ensure you ask questions to figure out if there was anything inhibiting volunteers from fulfilling their duties as efficiently as possible.

### Delegates and organizers

A great way to receive feedback from the Delegates and the other organizers is to hold a post-competition discussion. This can be done in person or online. Dinners after the competition, online calls, or online messaging are some good ways to do this. These discussions should recognize strengths, identify shortcomings, and discuss things that could be done differently at future competitions to improve them.

### Other

It is important to improve the experience of others (e.g. parents/guardians, spectators, vendors, and venue employees) too. Consider reaching out to them to ask how your organization team could improve their experience at future competitions.

Here are some questions that you should try to get an answer to:

- Were there any issues preventing volunteers from fulfilling their volunteer duties to the best of their abilities? How can you reduce the effects of these issues?
- Was there anything that caused the competition to run less efficiently than it could have run?
- Was there anything detracting from the enjoyment of competitors, volunteers, spectators, or Delegates?
- Were there any common incidents? If so, can any changes be made to reduce the frequency of the incidents?
- Were there any volunteers or competitors who caused repeated problems?
- What things that were tried out for the first time did or did not work? What caused them to fail or succeed?
- Were there any issues with first-time competitors? Can we prevent that issue at future competitions?
- What changes will be made for the next competition?
