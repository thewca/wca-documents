# Attitudes to New Competitors

For most competitions, there will be a percentage of competitors where this will be their first competition. This brief guide will give you some insight into how you should treat them, so you ensure they have a great experience and hopefully come to more competitions in the area.

## Intro for new competitors

One of the first impressions you will have with new competitors is the ‘intro for new competitors’ talk. In most cases this is done by the Delegate but you might to help in this. This isn’t a guide with a full ‘script’, and as there are some well-polished guides already out there, a few of them have been linked at the end of this section. However, here are some general tips and things to include, to ensure your inexperienced competitors have a fulfilling and educational experience:

- **Make sure to interact** - try not to make your tutorial a large wall of speech, people will lose interest - especially children that will make up most of your audience. You could ask them whether they know their group for 3x3 when you’re explaining how the group system works - or maybe ask for ‘hands up’ when asking them a question on how to receive a +2 penalty. Interaction will keep them on their toes and make sure they pay attention.
- **Do not rush** - you should allocate 15 minutes for the introduction. This is plenty of time! Don’t be afraid to pause and ask if everyone understands, or repeat yourself in certain sections. Speak loudly and slowly so everyone can grasp a good understanding on what you’re teaching them. Make sure to leave plenty of time for questions at the end as well - there are always a few questions people will have, even if they don’t want to speak up in front of the group. Try not use acronyms or abbreviations and if you do, explain them.
- **Make it competition appropriate** - for example, do not give a long tutorial on how to judge blindfolded events if your competition is not holding them. Additionally, make sure to explain the correct method for how judging at your competition will run (clarify if there will be fixed judges or not, how many stages there are, etc). When you are explaining judging, mention that you prefer people to check with a delegate if they’re not sure about something. Mention that everyone does this.
- **Alert competitors about regulation A7g** - Regulation A7g states “At the discretion of the WCA Delegate, an incident or penalty caused by a new competitor's inexperience may be replaced with an extra attempt.” Let them know this! Introduce the Delegate(s) at your competition and tell the competitors that if some confusion or controversy arises they can call a Delegate over so they can resolve the issue (e.g. decide whether or not an extra should be granted).

## How to talk to new competitors

Many newcomers will be rather young, maybe even small children, so make sure that they feel welcome! Do this as an organizer by hosting a friendly tutorial (mentioned above), but also as a competitor - have a chat with them in the competitor waiting area about what they average or what their favourite event is. It will go a long way in making them feel welcome, and hopefully they will want to come to more competitions.

## Dealing with Parents and Guardians {.page-break-before}

Most of the time, the parents or guardians will have some queries about something to do with the competition, whether it is about how to see their child's times online, or how many people go through to the next round, or just how a competition runs. It’s really important that as an organiser, you answer with a helpful and fulfilled answer, and if you cannot then make sure to pass them on to someone who can, e.g. a Delegate. Try to be polite and friendly so they enjoy your competition and want to attend more!
