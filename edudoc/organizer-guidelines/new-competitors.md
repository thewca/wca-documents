# Attitudes to First-Time Competitors

At most competitions, there will be competitors who are competing for the first time. This brief guide will give you some insight into how you should treat them to ensure they have a great experience and hopefully come to more competitions.

## First-Time Competitors Tutorial

One of the first impressions you will have with first-time competitors is during a first-time competitors tutorial. This is usually run by a Delegate, but organizers can help too. This is not a guide with a full script, as some well-polished guides already exist, a few of which are included at the end of this section. However, here are some general tips and topics to include to ensure your inexperienced competitors have a fulfilling and educational experience:

- **Ensure you interact.** Try not to make your tutorial a long speech. People will lose interest, especially the children who make up most of your audience. You can ask them whether they know their group for 3x3x3 Cube when you are explaining how the group system works or ask for “hands up” when asking them a question on how to receive a +2 penalty. The interactions will keep them engaged and help them pay attention.
- **Do not rush.** You should allocate 15 minutes for the introduction. This is plenty of time. Do not be afraid to pause and ask whether everyone understands or repeat yourself in some sections. Speak loudly and slowly so everyone can get a solid grasp of what you are telling them. Leave plenty of time for questions at the end. People will have questions, even if they do not want to speak up in front of the group. Avoid using acronyms or abbreviations unless you explain them.
- **Make it relevant to the competition.** For example, do not give a long tutorial on how to judge blindfolded events if your competition is not holding them. Additionally, explain the correct method of judging at your competition (e.g. clarify whether the judges will be seated or running and how many stages there are). When you are explaining judging, mention that you prefer people to check with a Delegate if they are uncertain about something. Mention that everyone does this.
- **Alert competitors about Regulation A7g.** Regulation A7g states, “At the discretion of the WCA Delegate, an incident or penalty caused by a first-time competitor’s inexperience may be replaced with an extra attempt”. Let them know this! Introduce the Delegates at your competition and tell the competitors that if some confusion or controversy arises, they may call a Delegate over so they can resolve the issue (e.g. decide whether an extra attempt should be granted).

## How to Talk to First-Time Competitors

Many first-time competitors will be rather young, maybe even small children, so ensure they feel welcome! Do this as an organizer by hosting a friendly tutorial (mentioned above). As a competitor - have a chat with them in the waiting area about what they average or what their favorite event is. It will go a long way in making them feel welcome and want to come to more competitions.

## Interacting with Parents/Guardians

Parents/guardians will often have questions about something to do with the competition, whether it is about how to see their child’s results online, how many competitors advance to the next round, or just how a competition runs. It is really important that you answer with a helpful and complete answer. If you cannot answer one of their questions, pass them on to someone else who can answer the question. Try to be polite and friendly so that they enjoy your competition and want to attend more!
