# Guidelines for Disciplinary Incidents

The WCA Integrity Committee (WIC) may apply sanctions based on the motion [Suspensions and other Sanctions](wcadoc{documents/motions/15.2025.1%20-%20Suspensions%20and%20other%20Sanctions.pdf}). While the WIC oversees integrity across all competitions, their ability to respond in real time is inherently limited. As a Delegate, you are not only present at the competition but also part of your local community. You might already know the people involved, can speak with them directly, talk to their parents/guardians, or assess the situation in ways that are simply not possible over email. You might notice details that show whether someone is being honest and help them do the right thing. The human element is critical and cannot be replaced by remote decision-making.

This document helps you navigate common disciplinary incidents. It outlines what actions you can take directly, when to involve the WIC, and how to handle incidents fairly and safely. Your role is crucial for maintaining integrity at competitions, and your judgment makes a real difference to the outcome of a particular case.

## Disciplinary Log and Banned Competitors

- A list of banned competitors can be found in the [Delegate panel](wca{panel/delegate#banned-competitors}). Only Junior Delegates and Full Delegates have access to this list. If a competitor attempts to attend a competition while banned, you should ask them to leave, and then you should contact the WIC. Familiarize yourself with your local laws and venue policies before requiring specific actions, and contact the local authorities if necessary.
- Formerly banned competitors are not visible on this list. However, when a formerly banned competitor registers for one of your competitions, you will receive an email alerting you of the competitor’s name and a brief reason for their former ban. When receiving this information, you should consider how to monitor the competitor and whether you should allocate resources. Delegates may reply directly to that email to ask the WIC for more details.
- Depending on the type and severity of a [Code of Conduct](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf}) violation, the WIC may ban a competitor from competing or attending competitions. The WIC will inform the local Delegates, usually through the Regional or Senior Delegate. If a competitor is banned from competing but not from attending competitions, they are permitted to attend competitions. They may also fulfill the roles of officials at competitions at the discretion of the Delegate.
- The WIC issues a quarterly digest of cases from the previous quarter and publishes reports on notable cases. These publications aim to educate the Community and WCA Volunteers and promote transparency. You can find them in the Announcements section of the WCA website and on the WCA Forum. A comprehensive list is available in the [Disciplinary Log](wca{disciplinary}). Delegates will also receive an expanded version of this digest alongside general announcements and resources.

## Handling Behavioral Issues of Competitors at Competitions

- When a competitor is involved in a minor behavioral incident at a competition, you should address it using Regulations [2j](wca{regulations/full/#2j}), [2k](wca{regulations/full/#2k}), and [2l](wca{regulations/full/#2l}) and applicable sub-points.
- It is important to follow the steps in order. You should try to handle minor incidents locally before requesting that the WIC get involved. The WIC is much less likely to apply any disciplinary action or open an investigation if you have not given warnings or disqualified competitors under [Regulation 2k](wca{regulations/full/#2k}). You should record noteworthy behavioral issues in case the WIC opens an investigation and would benefit from your information.
  - The WIC recommends the following escalation steps for behavioral issues that do not cause a safety concern (physical or emotional):
    1. General reminder – A polite reminder to reinforce the correct behavior.
    2. Formal warning – Clearly explain the potential consequences (e.g. disqualification) if the behavior continues, regardless of whether it occurred at the same competition. Consider involving the competitor’s parents/guardians at this step, and all subsequent steps, if it is appropriate based on the competitor’s age and/or cognitive abilities. Be direct!
    3. Disqualification from specific events – Enforce the consequences in the previous steps if the behavior persists, regardless of whether it occurred at the same competition. Consider different levels of event disqualification (i.e. a single event or a combination of events).
    4. Disqualification from the competition – If the disruption continues beyond the previous steps, disqualify the competitor from the rest of the competition, even if the behavior began at a previous competition.
    5. Additional disqualifications – If the behavior persists at a competition despite the competitor having been fully disqualified at a previous competition, disqualify the competitor again and inform the WIC.
  - If you do not follow these steps for behavioral issues that do not cause a safety concern, the WIC will likely be unwilling to intervene.
- If there is extreme behavior that could threaten competitor safety, please contact local law enforcement immediately. Safety is the top priority. Once the immediate safety concerns have been addressed, contact the WIC to report the details of what happened. The WIC cannot provide legal or emergency guidance.
- The WIC advises maintaining anonymity when writing about a behavioral issue in a Delegate Report. Write a brief, anonymized version of the incident and follow up with the WIC privately with further details, especially if the competitor is notable. The WIC will still provide feedback on anonymized versions for general awareness.
  - If the incident is sensitive (e.g. crimes, harassment, assault, etc.), please exclude all details from your Delegate Report and email the WIC separately.
  - Follow up with the WIC with the full details.
  - Please be aware the WIC will likely contact you for further information regarding the case.
- Please contact the WIC by adding their email address to the CC field in the Delegate Report thread or by emailing them directly if:
  - The incident cannot be resolved locally.
  - You believe that a person should be officially warned by the WIC or banned from competitions.
  - You believe that similar incidents could occur in the future and that it would be useful for WIC to document the incident.

## Theft at Competitions

- The WIC advises that theft (e.g. stealing puzzles) be investigated and resolved locally whenever possible, as the local Delegates can often resolve these cases better than the WIC. The priority for these cases is getting items returned to owners during the competition. The WIC generally does not apply disciplinary actions unless a competitor has been caught stealing after a previous warning or after all of the following conditions are met:
  - There is definitive evidence of the accused person committing theft (e.g. a witness seeing them steal, CCTV footage, admission of guilt, etc.).
  - The suspect has been contacted and asked to return the missing items.
  - The suspect has been unresponsive/uncooperative and has not returned the missing items.
- If you receive reports that lead you to believe there has been a theft, do your best to resolve the situation during the competition.
  - Make an announcement by giving a description of the missing items and advising competitors to give found items to an organizer or Delegate. In past cases, competitors have returned missing items after a gentle announcement.
  - Ask competitors whether they witnessed anything that could be related to the theft (e.g. someone standing next to a table where puzzles went missing or seeing someone playing with a puzzle that went missing).
  - Talk to any suspects and ask direct questions. If they confess and return any missing items, thank them for their honesty. If they deliberately took the item, warn them to avoid stealing in the future. Consider the age and maturity of the person when you are confronting them.
  - Ask a venue employee whether it is possible to view security camera footage to identify potential suspects.
- If puzzles were not returned by the end of the competition, but you believe you know who stole them, contact them and ask for the puzzles to be returned. Contact the WIC if the person is unresponsive or is unwilling to return the puzzles.
- Report cases of theft to the WIC so they can track them.

## Handling Behavioral Issues of Spectators at Competitions

- You should do your best to handle any issues from spectators in a respectful manner. Remember that as a Delegate, you are acting as official representatives of the WCA.
- Be aware of venue rules and policies. You could ask an official from the venue or local law enforcement to remove people causing problems.
- If there is extreme behavior that could threaten competitor safety, please contact local law enforcement immediately. Once the immediate safety concerns have been addressed, contact the WIC to report the details of what happened.

## Online Interactions (WCA Forum/Official WCA Platforms)

The scope of the [Code of Conduct](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf}) is limited to WCA Competitions and online on official WCA platforms. Therefore, the WIC cannot take any action following online incidents that happen outside of official WCA platforms.

- If people are being impolite or inappropriate in their online interactions related to competitions, please do your best to respectfully handle the situation. Remember that as a Delegate, you are a representative of the WCA. If the problem persists or you are uncertain of how to proceed, you may reach out to the WIC for advice on how to handle the situation.
- If you believe a person might engage in disruptive actions or pose a threat to the safety or well-being of anyone during a WCA competition based on their online behavior, please contact the WIC.
- For any incidents on the WCA Forum or other official WCA platforms, please contact the WCA Communications Team (WCT). The WIC prefers that minor behavioral incidents be handled “locally” online (e.g. giving warnings, mutes, or bans) on official WCA platforms before you request action from the WIC. When you see a behavioral issue on an official WCA platform, please only contact the WIC if it is a serious incident.

## Organizers

- If an organizer’s behavior falls outside the scope of the [Code of Conduct](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf}) but is still concerning or disruptive to the community, it is the Delegate’s discretion whether to work with them. For example, if an organizer has made harmful comments on a non-WCA Discord server, the Delegate may decide not to work with them.
- Carefully keep track of competition budgets and actual expenditures that take place, documenting expenditures with receipts whenever possible. If you believe that an organizer or legal entity is retaining leftover money from competitions for personal gain, please contact the WIC.

## WCA Volunteers

- If a WCA Volunteer violates or is strongly suspected of violating the Code of Conduct or Code of Ethics, report the situation directly to the WIC.
- The WIC will evaluate whether a further investigation is needed beyond intervention by a superior.
- Ensure the WIC is the correct Committee/Team to contact. The WCA Quality Assurance Committee or the WCA Regulations Committee might be a more appropriate point of contact for some types of concerns.
- Details must not be included in Delegate Reports, even if the information is anonymized.
- If you need to report a violation of the [Code of Conduct](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf}) or [Code of Ethics](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf}) of a WCA Volunteer who is a member of the WIC, report this behavior to the WCA Appeals Committee at [appeals@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:appeals@worldcubeassociation.org) instead.
- If you need to report a violation of the [Code of Conduct](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf}) or [Code of Ethics](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf}) of a WCA Board Member, you should contact the [WIC Leader and Senior Members](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/teams-committees-councils#wic) directly.

A concern or complaint might not clearly fall under a specific Committee/Team. It might be outside the WIC’s scope, require general mediation, or feel too minor to submit as a formal report but still important enough not to ignore. In these cases, use the hierarchy below to determine whom you should contact.

- Trainee / Junior / Full Delegate --> Regional Delegate --> Senior Delegate --> WCA Board
- Committee Member / Senior Member --> Committee Leader --> WCA Board
- Team Member / Senior Member --> Team Leader --> WCA Board

## Cheating {.page-break-before}

- If cheating is obvious, try to get evidence (e.g. videos, photos, names of people involved, email addresses of witnesses, etc.) and disqualify the competitor using [Regulation 2k2](wca{regulations/full/#2k2}). At your discretion, you may let the suspect complete the attempt or the round before disqualifying them while you gather more evidence.
  - For example, if a competitor is reported to have peeked on their first attempt of 3x3x3 Blindfolded, you might want to watch or record them peeking on their second and third attempts before disqualifying them instead of immediately disqualifying them. This would allow the WIC to have greater evidence, which is necessary for taking disciplinary action.
  - Explain to competitors why their actions were wrong. Try to explain the importance of fairness and ask them if they have cheated in similar ways in the past. Explain to them that their actions will be reported to the WIC and that the WIC can contact them. Also, explain that if a WIC investigation is started,  honesty will result in the best outcome for the competitor.
- Contact the WIC directly with a detailed report of the incident and any evidence gathered. A brief summary of the incident may be included in the report.

## Incidents Outside the Scope of the Code of Conduct

The scope of the [Code of Conduct](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf}) is limited to WCA Competitions and online on official WCA platforms. Therefore, the WIC cannot take any action following incidents that happen outside of this scope. If concerning behavior happens outside of this scope, follow the recommendations below:

- Contact authority figures who could resolve the situation, such as parents/guardians, school administrators, or moderators of a social media group.
- If the situation is serious enough (e.g. physical threats, bullying, abusive behavior, sexual harassment), contact local law enforcement. If a person is found criminally guilty by a court of law, please inform the WIC.
- If you feel it is necessary, communicate with the person about their behavior and contact the WIC, understanding that the WIC might not be able to apply sanctions. In your communications, make it clear that you are contacting them as a concerned person and not a representative of the WCA. For example, do not threaten disciplinary action from the WCA, such as removal from competitions.
  - If harassment or bullying is occurring online, advise the victim to block the perpetrators and contact the website’s administration.

## Managing Difficult Situations

Competitions can be demanding, difficult situations that can add another layer of stress. It is important to remain professional at all times. This will help your interactions with others to go more smoothly and allow you to represent the WCA positively. Remember the following points when managing a difficult situation:

- Remain calm during your interactions, speak slowly, avoid arguing, avoid shouting, do not use overly complicated jargon, and try to be understanding of others. Doing this will allow you to handle the situation in a calm manner and avoid conflict.
- If you are imposing an unpopular ruling, clearly explain why you are doing it. If the competitor is young, it might help to involve their parent/guardian. Some competitors are easily embarrassed. One way to defuse the tension is to let them know that the same situation has happened to you before.
  - Example: A young competitor does not start their timer correctly and becomes upset as their attempt has been given a DNF penalty. When speaking to their parents/guardians explaining what happened, use more straightforward terms such as “disqualify” rather than DNF. Show the competitor how to start the timer correctly. Tell them about a time it happened to you or a time when you had a particularly good scramble. Give them tips on how you have avoided this happening again.
- If you are becoming frustrated during an interaction, ask for help early or get another trusted person to step in. If this is not possible, consider taking a break from the situation and rediscussing the matter with the people involved later during the competition.
- When multiple difficult situations occur during a competition, try to prioritize which situation is the most important to handle first. Whenever possible, assign trusted people to manage the less important or less time-critical issues.
- After you have managed a difficult situation, it is important to debrief with other people. Speak with the other trusted people involved. Discuss what went well, what could have been improved, and what you learned. Avoid blaming others if things go poorly. If you were the only person involved, reach out to a Delegate you trust and debrief.
- Use the Delegate Report thread to gather feedback on how you managed the situation and how you could have managed it differently. This conversation also acts as a resource for others to learn how they can manage similar situations.
