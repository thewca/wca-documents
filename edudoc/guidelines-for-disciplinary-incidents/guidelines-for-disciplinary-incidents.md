# Guidelines for Disciplinary Incidents

The WCA Integrity Committee (WIC) is entitled to apply sanctions, based on the motion [Suspensions and other Sanctions](wcadoc{documents/motions/15.2025.1%20-%20Suspensions%20and%20other%20Sanctions.pdf}). However, the WIC is not able to handle difficult situations quickly during a competition, especially if communication with multiple involved parties is required. Cooperation with competition Delegates is often necessary, and Delegates can often gather evidence that the WIC would otherwise not have access to. This document contains a collection of guidelines to instruct new Delegates on how to handle common disciplinary incidents, what disciplinary measures they can take, and what they should report to the WIC.

## Disciplinary Log and Banned Competitors

- A list of banned competitors can be found in the [Delegate panel](wca{panel/delegate#banned-competitors}). Only Junior Delegates and Full Delegates have access to this list. If a competitor attempts to attend a competition when they are banned from doing so, please contact the WIC.
- Formerly banned competitors are not visible on this list. Instead, when a formerly banned competitor registers for a competition, the Delegates will receive an email alerting them of the competitor's name and a brief reason for their former ban. This will allow Delegates to potentially allocate resources or generally have awareness around what behavior to monitor for a given competitor. Delegates may reply directly to that email to contact WIC for more details if needed. 
- Depending on the degree of severity and type of violation of the [Code of Conduct](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf}), the WIC may ban a competitor from competing or attending competitions. Such a ban will be communicated with local Delegates when it is issued. If a competitor is banned from competing, but not from attending competitions, they are permitted to attend competitions. They may also fulfill the roles of officials at competitions at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- The WIC will publish reports on remarkable cases they've managed and issue a quarterly digest showcasing smaller resolved cases from the previous quarter. These publications aim to educate the Community and WCA Volunteers, promoting transparency. You can find them in the announcements section of the WCA website and on the WCA Forum, with a comprehensive list available in the [Disciplinary log](wca{disciplinary}).
- Delegates will also receive an expanded version of this digest alongside general announcements and resources.

## Handling Behavioral Issues of Competitors at Competitions

- Delegates should primarily address minor behavioral issues of competitors at competitions themselves using Regualtions [2j](wca{regulations/full/#2j}), [2k](wca{regulations/full/#2k}), and [2l](wca{regulations/full/#2l}) and applicable sub-points.
  - If Delegates have not first tried to handle minor behavior issues by giving warnings and disqualifying competitors under [Regulation 2k](wca{regulations/full/#2k}), then the WIC is much less likely to apply any disciplinary action. We would like Delegates to attempt to handle minor incidents at a local level first before WIC gets involved. However, the WIC would like Delegates to report noteworthy behavioral issues so the WIC can record them and provide guidance, if needed. 
  - The WIC recommends the following escalation steps for behavioral issues that do not cause a safety concern (physical or emotional):
    1. General reminder – A polite reminder reinforcing correct behavior.
    2. Formal warning – Clearly explain the potential consequences (e.g. disqualification) if the behavior continues, whether or not it occurred at the same competition. Consider involving the competitor's parents at this step, and all subsequent steps, if appropriate for the competitor's age and/or cognitive abilities. Be direct!
    3. Disqualification from specific event(s) – Enforce the aforementioned consequences if the behavior persists, whether or not it occurred at the same competition. Consider different levels of event disqualification (a single event or a combination of events).
    4. Disqualification from the competition – If the disruption continues beyond the previous steps, disqualify the competitor from the rest of the competition, whether or not it occurred at the same competition.
    5. Additional disqualifications – If the behavior persists at the next competition despite full disqualification being utilized, disqualify the competitor again and escalate the matter to WIC.
  - If these steps are not followed for behavioral issues that do not cause a safety concern, the WIC will likely not be willing to intervene.
- For extreme situations where competitor safety may be involved, please contact local law enforcement immediately. Once the immediate concerns of safety have been addressed, contact the WIC with all evidence gathered for the WIC to use in their investigation. Safety is priority, and the WIC cannot provide legal or emergency guidance.
- In the Delegate Report, the WIC generally advises to maintain anonymity for all types of incidents, however this is not required for typical incidents (such as disruptions and simple blindfolded peeking incidents).
  - If any extraordinary cases occur, default to a brief, anonymized version of the incident and follow-up with the WIC privately with further details, particularly if the competitor is notable. The WIC will still provide feedback on anonymized versions for general awareness.
  - If the WIC incident is sensitive (including but not limited to crimes, harassment, assault, etc.), please exclude all details from your report and email the WIC separately.
  - Follow-up with the WIC with full details.
  - Please be aware the WIC will likely contact you for further information regarding the case.
- Please contact the WIC (tagging in the Delegate Report or directly):
  - If the conflict cannot be resolved locally.
  - If you believe that a person should be officially warned by the WIC or banned from competitions.
  - If you believe that similar incidents may occur in the future and that it would be beneficial for the WIC to document the incident.

## Theft at Competitions

- The WIC's preference is for theft (such as stealing puzzles) to be investigated and resolved locally when possible, as the local Delegates can often resolve these cases better than the WIC. The priority for these cases is getting items returned to owners during the competition. The WIC will generally not apply disciplinary action unless a competitor has been caught stealing after a previous warning or all of the following conditions are met:
  - There is definitive proof of the accused person committing theft (such as a witness seeing them steal, CCTV footage, admission of guilt, etc.).
  - The suspect has been contacted and asked to return missing items.
  - The suspect has been unresponsive/uncooperative and has not returned missing items.
- If you receive reports that lead you to believe that there has been theft, then do your best to resolve the situation during the competition if possible.
  - Make an announcement, giving a description of missing items and advising competitors to give items to an organizer or Delegate if they are found. In past incidents, competitors have returned missing items after similar announcements.
  - Ask competitors if they witnessed anything that could be related to the theft (e.g. someone standing next to a table where puzzles went missing or seeing someone playing with a puzzle that went missing).
  - Talk to any suspects and ask direct questions. If they confess and return any missing items, thank them for their honesty and warn them to avoid stealing in the future if they deliberately took the item. Keep the age and maturity of the individual in mind.
  - Ask the venue for security camera footage to identify potential suspects if possible.
- If puzzles were not returned at the competition, but you believe you know who may have stolen them then contact them and ask for the puzzles to be returned. Contact the WIC if the individual is not responsive or is unwilling to return the puzzles.
- Report incidents of theft to the WIC so that we can note down competitor's names in case there are repeated cases of theft in the future.

## Handling Behavioral Issues of Spectators at Competitions {.page-break-before}

- Local Delegates should do their best to handle any issues that arise with spectators in a respectful manner, remembering that they are acting as official representatives of the WCA.
- Be aware of venue rules and policies. You may be able to ask an official from the venue or local law enforcement to remove individuals causing problems if needed.
- Contact local law enforcement immediately if there is extreme behavior that may threaten competitor safety. Once the immediate concerns of safety have been addressed, contact the WIC to report the details of what happened.

## Online Interactions (WCA Forum/Official WCA Platforms)

The [Code of Conduct](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf}) is limited in scope to WCA Competitions and online on official WCA platforms. As a result, the WIC cannot take any action in response to online incidents that happen outside of official WCA platforms.

- If competitors/parents/others are being impolite or inappropriate in their online interactions related to competitions, then please do your best to respectfully handle the situation (please keep in mind that you are a representative of the WCA). You may reach out to the WIC for advice on how to best handle the situation if the problem persists or you are unsure of how to proceed.
- If you feel a person may engage in disruptive actions or pose a threat to the safety or well-being or anyone during a WCA-sanctioned competition based on their online behavior, then please contact the WIC.
- For any incidents on the WCA forum or other official WCA platforms please contact the WCA Communications Team (WCT). The WIC would like for minor behavioral incidents to be handled "locally" online on official WCA platforms– such as through the means of warnings, mutes, or bans–before the WIC is contacted to request disciplinary action being enacted. Please only contact the WIC for serious incidents that take place online on official WCA platforms.

## Organizers

- Like any other competitors, report any violations of the [Code of Conduct](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf}) to the WIC.
- If an organizer's behavior falls outside the scope of the [Code of Conduct](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf}) but is still concerning or disruptive to the community, it is Delegate’s discretion whether to work with them. For example, if an organizer has made harmful comments on a non-WCA Discord, the Delegate may decide not to work with them. 
- Carefully keep track of competition budgets and actual expenditures that take place, documenting expenditures with receipts when possible. If you believe that an organizer or legal entity is retaining leftover money from competitions for personal gain then please contact the WIC.

## WCA Volunteers {.page-break-before}

- For initial reports, consider contacting the Volunteer's superior alongside the WIC. The Regional Delegate or Senior Delegate are the first contact for Delegate concerns, and Team/Committee Leaders for other Volunteers.
- The WIC may be included in these reports for tracking purposes, and to evaluate if a further investigation is needed beyond intervention by a superior.
- Ensure the WIC is also the correct team to contact. The WCA Quality Assurance Committee or the WCA Regulations Committee may be a more appropriate point of contact for some concerns.
- Reports must not be included in Delegate Reports, even if the information is anonymized.
- If you need to report a violation of the [Code of Conduct](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf}) or [Code of Ethics](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf}) of a WCA Volunteer who is a member of the WIC, then please report this behavior to the WCA Appeals Committee at [appeals@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:appeals@worldcubeassociation.org).

## Cheating

- If cheating is obvious, try to get evidence (especially videos, photos, names of people involved, and email addresses of witnesses) and disqualify the competitor using [Regulation 2k2](wca{regulations/full/#2k2}). At your discretion, you may let the suspect complete the attempt or the round before disqualifying them, in order to gather more evidence.
  - For example, if a competitor is reported to have peeked on their first attempt of 3x3 blindfolded, it may be desirable to watch them/record them peeking on their 2nd and 3rd attempts before disqualification, as opposed to immediately disqualifying the competitor. This allows the WIC to have greater evidence, which is necessary for taking disciplinary action.
  - Explain to competitors why their actions were wrong, try to explain the importance of fairness, and ask them if they have cheated in similar ways in the past. Explain to them that their actions will be reported to the WIC and that the WIC may contact them. Also explain that if a WIC investigation is started, that honesty will result in the best outcome for the competitor.
- Tag the WIC in the Delegate report about the case. Give a rough outline of the incident for the education of other Delegates, but avoid including any evidence or identifying information in the report such as videos that reveal the identity of competitors or names of competitors accused of cheating.
- Contact the WIC directly with a detailed description of the incident, and any evidence gathered.

## Incidents Outside the Scope of the Code of Conduct

The [Code of Conduct](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf}) is limited in scope to WCA Competitions and online on official WCA platforms. As a result, the WIC cannot take any action in response to incidents that happen outside of this scope. If concerning behavior happens outside of this scope, below are some recommendations.

- Contact authority figures that may be able to resolve the situation, such as parents, school administrators, or moderators of a social media group.
- If the situation is serious enough (e.g. physical threats, bullying, abusive behavior, sexual harassment) then contact local law enforcement. If an individual is found criminally guilty by a court of law, please inform the WIC.
- If you feel it is necessary, communicate with the individual about their behavior and contact the WIC, keeping in mind that the WIC may not be able to apply sanctions. In your communications make it clear that you are contacting them as a concerned individual and not a representative of the WCA. For example, do not threaten disciplinary action from the WCA, such as removal from competitions.
  - If harassment/bullying is occurring online, advise the victim to block the perpetrator(s).

## Managing Difficult Situations {.page-break-before}

Competitions can be demanding, difficult situations that can add another level of stress. It is essential to remain professional at all times; this will help your interactions with others to go more smoothly, and allow you to positively represent the WCA. Keep in mind the following points when managing a difficult situation:

- Remain calm during your interactions, speak slowly, avoid arguing, avoid shouting, don't use overly complicated jargon, and try to be understanding of others. Doing this will allow you to handle the situation in a calm manner and avoid conflict.
- If you are imposing an unpopular ruling, explain clearly why you are doing it. If the competitor is young, it may be beneficial to involve their parent/guardian. Some competitors are easily embarrassed. One way to defuse that tension is to draw from personal experience, and let them know that the same situation has happened to you before.
  - Example: a young competitor doesn't start their timer correctly and becomes upset as their attempt has been given a DNF penalty. Speak to their parents, use more straightforward terms such as "disqualify" rather than DNF, to explain what happened. Show the competitor how to start the timer correctly. Tell them about a time it happened to you, maybe a time when you had a particularly good scramble. Give them tips on how you have avoided this happening again.
- If you are becoming frustrated during an interaction, ask for help early or get another Delegate/organizer/trusted person to step in. If this is not possible consider taking a break from the situation and rediscussing the matter with the people involved at a later point in the competition.
- When there are multiple difficult situations occurring at competitions, try and prioritize what is the most important and where possible assign others (either Delegates, organizers or other trusted individuals) to deal with the less important or less time-critical issues.
- After you have managed a difficult situation, it is important to debrief. Speak with the other Delegates/organizers/trusted people involved; discuss what went well, what could've been improved, what you learned, and avoid blaming others if things went poorly. If you were the only person involved, reach out to a Delegate you trust and debrief.
- Use the Delegate report as a resource to gather feedback on how you managed the situation, and how you could have managed the situation differently. This also acts as a resource for others to learn how they may be able to manage similar situations.
