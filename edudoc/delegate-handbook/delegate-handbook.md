# Delegate Handbook

The _Delegate Handbook_ is an educational and referential resource for WCA Delegates of all levels of experience, whether you are a newly appointed Trainee Delegate or a Full Delegate who has attended over one hundred competitions. This document attempts to lay a foundation for the required responsibilities and the most common scenarios experienced by a Delegate so that every WCA competition can run with consistent levels of fairness and quality.

This handbook is _not_ a guide on how to organize or run a competition. Organizational tasks are often handled by Delegates, but they can also be handled by Community organizers. As such, organizational details are generally excluded in this handbook and can instead be found within the [Organizer Guidelines](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/organizer-guidelines).

While this handbook aims to be complete, it cannot be fully comprehensive. While delegating, you will almost certainly run into situations that could not possibly be foreseen or predicted. As you delegate more competitions, you will build a foundation of experience that will allow you to independently handle scenarios not covered in this handbook.

Finally, the _Delegate Handbook_ aims to reflect official WCA policy, not create it. When a disagreement or contradiction arises, always defer to the official policy, Regulation, or precedent published by the WCA. See the [Contributing to this Document](#contributing-to-the-delegate-handbook) section for information on how to update this handbook to accurately reflect reality.

There is a lot of information that is relevant to all WCA Volunteers, not just Delegates. If you have not already, read the [WCA Volunteer Crash Course](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/edudoc/volunteer-crash-course/volunteer_crash_course.pdf) to get a high-level overview of the responsibilities expected of every WCA Volunteer.

# Introduction to Delegating {.page-break-before}

Delegates are one of the most prominent roles within the World Cube Association. A Delegate represents the WCA at a cubing competition to ensure that competitors adhere to the rules of each event and maintain fair play throughout the competition. Most importantly, all Delegates must have a strong understanding of the [WCA Regulations](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/) and their associated [Guidelines](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html).

As the face of the WCA to the attendees of a competition, a Delegate has many considerations and responsibilities to effectively fulfill their duties. This handbook is designed to capture those considerations and responsibilities in a unified place as a reference handbook for Delegates of all levels of experience.

While Delegates are highly experienced Community members and often help out as organizers, it is important that they understand the distinction between their role as a Delegate and their role as an organizer. While some organizational tasks are often performed by a Delegate, such as generating groups and providing competition equipment, these are ultimately the organizer’s responsibility. Remember whose duties you are fulfilling, as it is important to distinguish actions performed as a representative of the WCA and as a non-WCA organizer.

## The Duties of a WCA Delegate

As outlined in the [WCA Delegates Motion](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/motions/08.2024.1%20-%20Delegates.pdf) of the WCA, a Delegate is responsible for the following:

- Ensuring the Regulations are followed at WCA competitions
- Submitting competition results
- Writing competition reports
- Representing their local community within the WCA
- Staying up to date on the WCA Regulations
- Staying up to date on internal conversations with WCA Volunteers

## How to Become a Delegate

A person typically becomes a Trainee Delegate after being recommended by a Delegate who has determined that they would like another Delegate to help manage their local community. Candidates are noticed for their maturity and responsibility and are most frequently selected from experienced organizers and competition volunteers. The Delegate will recommend the candidate to their Regional Delegate who will review the recommendation and agree or disagree with it.  The recommendation will then be forwarded to the Senior Delegate. If there is no Regional Delegate, the Senior Delegate will review the recommendation instead. If the Senior Delegate approves the appointment, they will send an application to the WCA Board of Directors, who will reject or approve the application. After approval, the Senior Delegate will appoint the candidate as a Trainee Delegate.

The ideal candidate for a new Trainee Delegate has the following:

- Full trustworthiness
- A strong, independent, communicative, collaborative, and positive personality
- Leadership skills and responsibility
- Organizational skills and the ability to complete required tasks
- Fluency in English to effectively participate in internal WCA communications
- A few hours of free time per week to work on Delegate tasks
- Experience as an organizer with a history of successful competitions

There is no minimum age requirement for becoming a Trainee Delegate. However, the responsibilities of a Delegate tend to reflect individuals who are adults, with rare exceptions for outstanding candidates under 18 years old.

## Delegate Tiers

There are multiple tiers of Delegates, each with their own responsibilities within the WCA. All tiers of Delegates have one thing in common: at a WCA competition, they all have the responsibility to ensure that competitions are run in accordance with the Regulations.

### Trainee Delegates

A Delegate will typically start their journey by being appointed as a Trainee Delegate. A Trainee Delegate’s primary responsibility is learning how to delegate WCA competitions. Usually, this will involve shadowing another Delegate to learn the ropes of delegating. This generally includes the entire competition process: working with organizers, preparing for the competition, delegating at the competition, posting results and writing reports after the competition, and interacting with other WCA Volunteers in internal communications.

When appointed, a Trainee Delegate gains access to the following:

- The “New Competition” page of the WCA website
- The ability to manage users and edit profiles on the WCA website
- The Delegate Reports mailing list

A Trainee Delegate has the same permissions and responsibilities as a Junior Delegate, except the following:

- Trainee Delegates cannot post Delegate Reports, confirm competitions, or submit results. Trainee Delegates may still compile results and write Delegate Reports but are only restricted from submitting them.
- Trainee Delegates cannot delegate a competition without another Junior Delegate or higher. The only exception is when there is an emergency, in which case the WCA Board may allow a Trainee Delegate to Delegate a competition without supervision by another Delegate.
- Trainee Delegates cannot vote in Volunteer polls. This is separate from “voting rights” in the WCA.
- Trainee Delegates are not given WCA email addresses.

A Trainee Delegate is a Community member and not a WCA Volunteer. However, a Trainee Delegate is still expected to embody the full responsibilities of a Delegate and shall behave as a representative of the WCA in accordance with the Mission, Spirit, Policies, and Code of Ethics of the WCA.

A Trainee Delegate’s training period is not just an evaluation of their skills. It is an opportunity for the Trainee Delegate to understand more fully what is expected of them. Sometimes, a Trainee Delegate finds that delegating is not a good match for them. This is okay! A Trainee Delegate may withdraw their appointment at any time by submitting a resignation letter to their Senior Delegate and adding the WCA Board and WCA Executive Assistants Team (WEAT) to the Carbon Copy (CC) field.

After 12 months, a Trainee Delegate will automatically lose their appointment as a Trainee Delegate unless their Senior Delegate extends the appointment with approval from the WCA Board.

A Trainee Delegate is promoted to Junior Delegate after their Senior Delegate determines their readiness for promotion. This is usually after a Trainee Delegate demonstrates their capability as a Delegate over the course of a few competitions. A Senior Delegate might be unable to personally evaluate the performance of a Trainee Delegate and might consult Regional Delegates and Full and Junior Delegates local to the Trainee Delegate to get a better understanding of the Trainee Delegate’s performance.

### Junior Delegates

A Junior Delegate is in the lowest tier of WCA Delegates and is officially a WCA Volunteer. They have demonstrated sufficient responsibility and are granted the independence to represent the WCA without direct supervision. However, a Junior Delegate is still expected to continue to gain experience in their role and might require attention from their Senior Delegate or local Delegates.

A Junior Delegate has the same responsibilities as a Trainee Delegate and gains the following:

- The ability to submit results, confirm competitions, and post Delegate Reports
- The ability to delegate competitions without another Delegate
- A WCA email address
- Access to internal WCA resources accessed through their email login
- Access to the Poll areas of the WCA website

A Senior Delegate may promote a Junior Delegate to Full Delegate if the Junior Delegate has held the position for at least one year and has successfully managed at least three WCA Competitions.

Each quarter (three months), the WCA Executive Assistants Team (WEAT) checks which Junior Delegates are eligible for promotion and will request Senior Delegates to choose who they believe are ready for promotion. Once a Senior Delegate returns to the WEAT with their selected candidates for promotion, the WEAT will request feedback from the following WCA Teams and Committees:

- The WCA Competition Announcement Team (WCAT) looks into the cleanliness of competition submissions. Generally, this is determined by the number and severity of mistakes in competition submissions, the timeliness of competition submissions (i.e. minimal submissions with under 30 days until the competition), and responsiveness to email inquiries. The Delegate must have confirmed at least one competition (i.e. by clicking the “Confirm” button themself) to be eligible for a positive review from the WCAT. All of the Delegate’s confirmed competitions may be considered, with more consideration given to recent competitions.
- The WCA Quality Assurance Committee (WQAC) looks into the timeliness of Delegate Reports being submitted, scramble accountability at that Delegate’s competitions, and the general quality of their competitions. All of the Delegate’s competitions may be considered, with more consideration paid to recent competitions.
- The WCA Results Team (WRT) looks into the cleanliness of a Delegate’s result submissions, change requests, and responsiveness to WRT questions. The Delegate must have submitted results at least three times to be eligible for a positive review from the WRT.
- WCA Regulations Committee (WRC) uses the Incidents section of Delegate Reports to verify that incidents are being handled correctly and prompt change requests are made after feedback is provided.
- The WCA Financial Committee (WFC) verifies that dues are paid within 30 days and that other invoices are paid in a timely manner. This is not applicable to Delegates who have their dues covered by a Regional Organization. See [Paying Competition Dues](#paying-competition-dues) for more information on how Dues are paid.
- The WCA Integrity Committee (WIC) verifies that there are no active investigations into the Delegate.

If the Senior Delegate, WCA Teams, Committees, and the Board all agree that a Junior Delegate is ready for promotion, the Senior Delegate will promote the Junior Delegate to Full Delegate. Promotion to Full Delegate recognizes that person’s hard work and contribution to the WCA over a period of time while maintaining high standards. If a Delegate is not promoted, their promotion is simply postponed until the next promotion cycle (i.e. next quarter).

### Full Delegates

A Full Delegate, also known as simply a Delegate, has the same responsibilities as a Junior Delegate. However, they have demonstrated a commitment to the WCA as an organization and so are granted voting rights within the WCA. When the WCA conducts a formal vote, such as when electing Board members, only eligible voting members are allowed to vote. Voting members are Full Delegates, Regional Delegates, Senior Delegates, Senior members of WCA Teams and Committees, and leaders of Teams and Committees.

Full Delegate is the highest level that most Delegates will attain in their career as a WCA Volunteer. However, there are additional managerial and supervision-based duties for Delegates who wish to take on additional responsibilities within the WCA.

### Regional Delegates

In addition to the responsibilities of a Full Delegate, a Regional Delegate helps oversee and manage competitions in a broader region than their immediate local cubing community. They are responsible for maintaining quality standards in their local community and supporting their local Full Delegates, Junior Delegates, and Trainee Delegates in performing their respective duties. A Regional Delegate is expected to act as a leader of Delegates within their region, encourage continuous improvement of competition quality, and evaluate the area’s needs for additional Delegates. A Regional Delegate’s responsibilities are largely the same as a Senior Delegate’s, but the smaller assigned region allows a Regional Delegate to pay closer attention to the needs of their region and their Delegates than a Senior Delegate can.

Regional Delegates are appointed by a Senior Delegate in conjunction with the WCA Board on an as-needed basis determined by the Senior Delegate. A Regional Delegate’s appointment time is indefinite, although a Regional Delegate may step down from their position voluntarily or have their appointment removed by the WCA Board in consultation with the Senior Delegate if they do not fulfill their responsibilities.

Not every region has a Regional Delegate. If a region does not have a Regional Delegate, the Senior Delegate fulfills these responsibilities.

### Senior Delegates

A Senior Delegate is the highest level of Delegate within the WCA. They are responsible for overseeing the largest geographic divisions in the WCA, appointing Trainee Delegates, and promoting Delegates to higher roles.

A Senior Delegate is appointed by the WCA Board for a period of 24 months. After 24 months, the appointment automatically expires unless extended by the WCA Board. Extensions can be of any length of time up to an additional 24 months. The maximum appointment length of a Senior Delegate is 48 months. Senior Delegates may re-apply for the position after the end of this period.

Some regions might not have a Senior Delegate appointed. If no Senior Delegate is appointed, the WCA Board fulfills these responsibilities.

The regions with Senior Delegates are:

- Africa
- Asia East and Southeast
- Asia West and South
- Central Eurasia
- Europe
- Latin America
- Oceania
- USA and Canada

## Email

Most official WCA communication, both within the organization and to the general public, happens via email. When a WCA Volunteer sends you an email, you are expected to respond in a timely manner unless special circumstances arise. Most of the time, you are expected to have a response within 48 hours, but within a week at worst. Sometimes, it is unreasonable to write a meaningful response within the time frame, or you are waiting for other people to respond before you can write your response. If this happens, let the sender know that you have seen their message and that you intend to follow up by a specific deadline.

**Do not use your WCA email for tasks that are explicitly organizer-related, such as contacting sponsors for a competition**, as this could give a false impression that the WCA is organizing the competition. If the competition is being organized by a Regional Organization you are part of, use an email address assigned by your Regional Organization to to perform organizer tasks. Otherwise, use your personal email. You are still expected to use your WCA email for internal communications and communication with competitors about delegating tasks, such as managing personal data.

If you are reaching out to a WCA Volunteer, Team, or Committee, it is possible for them to mistakenly overlook your email. After 48 hours, you may follow up on your initial message with a response to get the attention of the recipient.

For more information on internal WCA communication, see [Engaging in Internal Discussions](#engaging-in-internal-discussions).

## Confidentiality

As a Delegate, you might occasionally become aware of confidential information. Please exercise responsibility when discussing such information. The following information is considered confidential and must not be shared outside of WCA Volunteers:

- Delegate Reports
- Internal WCA emails
- Non-public personal information of competitors as described in the [WCA Privacy Statement](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/privacy) and [Regulation 2d](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#2d)
  - Exception: the contact information of competitors can be shared with their explicit permission. Permission grants are one-way. If Person A gives you permission to share their contact information with Person B, only give Person A’s contact information to Person B, and do not give Person B’s personal information to anyone else.
- Personal information of WCA Volunteers
- Banned competitors list

In addition, the following information must be kept confidential even among other WCA Volunteers, except for specific individuals on a need-to-know basis, such as those conducting an investigation on behalf of the WIC:

- Information regarding an investigation by the WIC, including the identity of individuals involved in the investigation or details about the investigation
- Information regarding confidential information and partnerships with the WCA and external organizations

Large Language Models hosted by third-party vendors such as ChatGPT are potential ways to accidentally disclose confidential information. **Do not input confidential information into these tools**.

In general, use your best judgment about confidentiality and err on the side of caution when it comes to disclosing potentially sensitive information.

## Probation

Delegates who fail to do their duties could be placed on probation. The full details of probation can be viewed in the [WCA Delegate Probationary Status Policy](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/internal/Delegate%20Probationary%20Status.pdf). Probation is an internal designation of which only the Delegate on probation, Regional Delegate, Senior Delegate, Board, and relevant Committees and/or Teams would be aware. A Delegate could be placed on probation for the following:

- Late Delegate Report submissions
  - After two consecutive late reports, the WEAT will inform their Senior Delegate, who may then put the Delegate on probation. After submitting three consecutive reports on time, the Delegate’s probation may be removed.
- Late results submissions
- Late payments of Invoices for WCA Dues or equipment orders
- Quality issues, including but not limited to:
  - Demonstrated patterns of scheduling issues
  - Repeated issues leading to results being retroactively removed
  - Failure to handle Delegate responsibilities, such as changes to personal data, in a reasonable time frame
  - Failure to follow WCA policies

The WFC may directly place Delegates on probation for outstanding payments without prior approval. A WCA Team or Committee with a relevant complaint may request that a Delegate be put on probation by contacting the Senior Delegate of that Delegate. Delegates who fail to improve in a specific time period may be demoted.

# Before the Competition {.page-break-before}

Delegates have several responsibilities before a competition happens. The _Delegate Handbook_ is not intended to be a set of guidelines on how to organize a competition. This handbook covers the responsibilities of a Delegate that go beyond simply organizing a competition. Refer to the [Organizer Guidelines](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/organizer-guidelines) to learn how to organize a competition.

## Competitions and Your Community

Fostering the health of the local cubing community is one of a Delegate’s responsibilities. Every cubing community is different, with a unique combination of factors that determine the best competition frequency, size, and event selection for the community.

### Competition Frequency

While the demand for competitions will vary by region, a cuber generally benefits from one competition at least every few months. A good minimum goal for an established cubing community is one competition per season. Most large and highly engaged communities can support monthly competitions.

As each community varies, the exact frequency of competitions in your area will depend on many factors, and it is your responsibility as a Delegate to monitor the landscape and make educated decisions based on your assessment of the needs of the local cubing community. Generally speaking, it is better to provide slightly too many competitions than too few, as too few competitions will mean that your competitions are likely filling up and people who would like to compete are not granted the opportunity. If you are feeling overwhelmed by the number of competitions needed to support your community, it might be time to onboard new Delegates. See the [Recommending a Delegate](#recommending-a-delegate) section for information on adding new Delegates to your community.

### Competition Size

Aim to hold competitions large enough that they do not fill up immediately. Competitions that fill up too quickly are a sign that there is more demand than can be satisfied by a particular competition. If you notice this happening regularly in your community, prioritize competitions in larger venues that allow more people to compete.

If larger venues are unavailable or are inaccessible for reasons such as cost, additional demand can be satisfied by offering more competitions (e.g. through onboarding new Delegates for the community, see above), by adjusting competition schedules/formats to prioritize the number of individual competitors over the number of rounds/events, and/or by holding series competitions. Series competitions are a good way to satisfy demand when larger venues are unavailable since they allow for one or multiple venues to be split across more competitors. However, series competitions have the following potential downsides:

- **Splitting the community.** Competitors will be unable to compete at both competitions, which results in competitors having to choose between two or more competitions. Therefore, each set of competitors at your competitions will have different experiences with two completely independent sets of competitors.
- **Shorter competitions.** If you are using the same venue for a series, you must split the time at that venue that you could use for one competition into two or more shorter competitions. In practice, this usually involves splitting a potential two-day competition into two one-day competitions or a one-day competition into two half-day competitions occurring in the morning and afternoon.

Event selection could also have a big impact on the demand for a competition. Having too many popular events could overwhelm demand for a single competition, and having too many side events could lead to competitions not filling up and demand not being met. One potential approach is holding less frequent but larger competitions with the most popular events while filling the time between these large competitions with smaller ones that focus on less popular events. See the next section for more information on selecting appropriate events for your community.

### Event Selection

Unsurprisingly, some events are more popular than others. The most popular events in the WCA are 3x3x3 Cube, 2x2x2 Cube, Pyraminx, Skewb, 4x4x4 Cube, and 3x3x3 One-Handed. When trying to satisfy the demand for very large competitions or putting on competitions that are more beginner-friendly, prioritize these events over others.

Establishing regular competitions in a region also affords some flexibility to event selection. When competitions can be held regularly, they can be planned to cover the entire catalog of WCA events. A common pattern for one-day competitions is to hold three to seven events at a competition, where one of two of them is a popular event, and the others rotate between a selection of the less popular events. Over the course of a year, this allows the most popular events to be held multiple times while providing competitors the opportunity to compete in almost every event at least once.

The primary exceptions to this event schedule are the “quiet events”: 3x3x3 Blindfolded, 4x4x4 Blindfolded, 5x5x5 Blindfolded, 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, and 3x3x3 Fewest Moves. They are more advanced events and tend to have lower demand, with the exception of 3x3x3 Blindfolded. It is common for these events to be bundled into “Please Be Quiet” (PBQ) or “Mental Breakdown” competitions, which hold almost exclusively these advanced events. The lower turnout can make it easier to organize competitions, as smaller venues are required.

The following is an example competition plan for five competitions that cover all the events over the course of a year. Four standard competitions and one PBQ competition are a good starting point for a healthy cubing community. Modify the frequency of particular events and the number of competitions to best match the preferences and skill levels of the local community.

As a Delegate, you might occasionally find yourself in the position of delegating in a region that does not have established Delegates or does not hold regular competitions. While it could seem like a good idea to choose as many events as possible to afford competitors the rare opportunity to compete in as many events as possible, underdeveloped communities often do not have enough skilled cubers to justify having some of the more advanced events. This can lead to slow rounds when there are not enough skilled individuals to fulfill important duties such as scrambling. Time at WCA-recognized competitions is much more valuable to these communities than it is to well-established communities. If the region is highly underdeveloped and does not get regular access to Delegates, consider holding more rounds of beginner-friendly events with long cutoff times and large advancement groups over less popular events. When regular competitions can be established in those communities, it is safer to start holding less popular events, as time will not be spent catering to events with relatively few people competitors.

## Organizing a Competition

As a Delegate, you will often have more experience organizing WCA competitions than Community organizers. While Delegates can and often do much of the work organizing competitions, especially with inexperienced organizers, this handbook aims to cover only the Delegate’s responsibilities. For detailed information about the responsibilities involved with organizing competitions, see the [Organizer Guidelines](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/organizer-guidelines).

### Community Organizers and Delegate Organizers

There is a spectrum of how WCA competitions are organized, with organizer-led competitions on one end and Delegate-led competitions on the other. Organizer-led competitions involve a Community member doing most of the work preparing for and running a competition, while a Delegate does the minimum amount of work required of them: receiving a competition proposal, confirming a competition on the WCA website, generating scrambles, showing up to the competition in person to verify that the Regulations are being upheld, and submitting results. On the other end of the spectrum are Delegate-led competitions, where a Delegate handles every aspect of organizing a competition and often the overall arc of multiple competitions in a region.

In practice, fully organizer-led competitions are rare, as there are many possible points of failure that could prevent a competition from happening entirely or happening at an unacceptably low level of quality. On the other hand, Delegate-led competitions are common in very small cubing communities with only one or two Delegates and in very large and mature regions that have many Delegates under the umbrella of a Regional Organization.

Most competitions lie somewhere between these two extremes. Some Delegates might prefer to get proposals on potential venues from Community members but otherwise organize the competitions themselves. Other times, a Delegate will work with the organizer to guide them through the entire organizational process, effectively performing many of the organizational tasks themself. As an organizer gets more experienced and demonstrates capability, a Delegate might feel more comfortable relaxing this level of supervision. Ultimately, however, the Delegate is responsible for ensuring that every organizational task is completed by the time the competition begins, so most Delegates will maintain some degree of involvement in the organizational process.

### Interacting with Organizers

When helping out an inexperienced organizer, be gracious with your assistance, as most organizers are also generous with their own free time to organize a competition to support their community. A Delegate has a position of authority within a cubing community, so use that position to foster a welcoming environment.

WCA competitions take a lot of work to organize. Some prospective organizers might not be fully aware or capable of the amount of effort that will be required of them to successfully organize a competition. Use the time before submitting a competition to the WCAT to evaluate the ability of an organizer to fulfill their responsibilities by asking them to draft budgets, draw layouts, create schedules, and populate the competition website. The ability of the organizers to complete these steps to the best of their ability is often a good indicator of their ability to organize a competition. However, be mindful of the level of experience of the organizer: an organizer who creates an unoptimized schedule could be guided toward creating a better one. An organizer who entirely neglects to create one is a bigger problem.

WCA competitions are **not for profit**. Decline competition proposals from individuals who appear to be organizing a competition for personal gain.

As a Delegate, you are not obligated to follow through on any competitions that have not yet been announced. At any point before confirming the competition, if you believe that it would be best for the competition not to happen, you may rescind your acceptance to delegate it. Do this cautiously. Try to get the best indication of the likelihood of success for a competition before any contracts are signed or any money is spent. However, once a competition is announced, you are responsible for seeing it through to completion. For more information, see the [Competition Cancelation and Rescheduling](#competition-cancelation-and-rescheduling) section.

## Requesting a Competition

Before a competition appears on the WCA website, a Delegate must create a new competition page on the WCA website and submit it to the WCA Competition Announcement Team (WCAT). The WCAT will review the competition details and then either approve or reject your competition proposal. When approved, a competition will be publicly viewable on the WCA website.

To create a new competition page, go to the “New Competition” page and fill out the entire form. You also have the option to clone an existing competition, which will copy all of the information of an existing competition. To clone a competition, go to its page and click the “Clone” button on the left sidebar.

### General Rules

There are some rules about how and when competitions must be requested. These are outlined in the [WCA Competition Requirements Policy](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Competition%20Requirements.pdf) (WCRP). In particular, remember the following:

- The competition must be announced **at least 28 days** before midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of the first day of the competition. **Submit the competition earlier than this** as a safety measure so that if there is an issue with the competition, then the competition will likely still be announced before the 28-day deadline.
- The competition must comply with the proximity requirements. This means the competition must be at least 10 kilometers and 5 days away from all other competitions. Exceptions apply when the competitions have no overlapping events or are held in different countries.

### Filling Out the New Competition Page

The following are guidelines for filling out the [New Competition page](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/new). The special rules for Fewest Moves simultaneous competitions override some of the rules written here. See the [Requesting a Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competition](#requesting-a-fewest-moves-simultaneous-competition) section for more information.

- The name of the competition must follow the WCRP. Even if you are choosing a name that is obvious to you why it complies with the policy, you must still give an explanation of the name in the “The reason for the name” field.
  - The competition nickname must be the same as the actual name of the competition if it is 32 or fewer characters, with few exceptions. If the name of the competition is over 32 characters, pick a nickname as close as possible to the actual name. The nickname is only used for display purposes and is what will be shown on the “Competitions” page and in the “Rankings” page.
  - The competition ID must be the same as the name or nickname with few exceptions, and spaces and special characters must be removed.
- When writing the location of the venue, please use the correct formatting. Do not write the country name in the “City name” field. If you are from a country that includes the province/state in the “City name” field (e.g. Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, UK, and USA), you must write the city name first and then the province/state in full.
- The coordinates of the competition must be set correctly. Zoom in on the map pin and ensure it is pointing where the venue is, not to some nearby street.
  - There are two places where coordinates must be updated: one for the location of the competition as a whole under the “Organizer view” and another for the venue itself, under the “Manage schedule” tab and the “Edit venues information” dropdown. Usually, these locations listed here are the same, but if your competition spans multiple locations (e.g. a PBQ day held in a smaller venue on one day of a multi-day competition), update the location of the venue accordingly.
- The competitor limit must be listed and must be suitable for the community. The WCAT will use past competitions in the area to determine whether this competitor limit is acceptable.
  - Many regions have minimum competitor limits for competitions with specific events. These limits can be found in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TacpcAhPCeILFgN1CvQIfguWnRCT7bZNrXJZusA75EU/edit?usp=sharing).
- The relevant information must be filled out so that the automated registration requirements reflect the rules for signing up for the competition. This includes the competitor limit, registration fee, spectator fee, refund policy, and information on whether you are accepting on-site registrations.
  - The box for Extra Registration Requirements must only be used to explain something regarding the registration requirements or something important regarding the registration process that is not otherwise reflected. This is the place to include details for a money transfer. It is also okay to state that payment details will be sent to the competitor once they register. This can include the service through which the potential payment will take place if Stripe is not being used. This can also include foreign competitors contacting the organization team to be accepted if an alternate payment method is used.
- If you are not local to where the competition will take place, please inform local Delegates and ensure they are okay with you delegating it before you confirm it.
- If your competition is not on a weekend, please mention it in the “Remarks” section.

### Adding Events and a Schedule

Every WCA competition page must include a schedule tab and an events tab.

- The “Manage Events” page is under the “Edit” section on the left sidebar. You must fill out the number of rounds for each event and the round formats, cutoffs, time limits, and advancement conditions for each round. Remember to click save! This will create an “Events” tab on the competition page, which will be visible to everyone. This is used as an events overview for competitors.
- Once the events page is set up, you can create the schedule. The “Manage Schedule” page is under the “Edit” section. You can find all of the events and rounds that you filled out on the “Manage Events” page. When you have filled the schedule out with all the rounds in their respective allocated time slots, click save. This will create a new “Schedule” tab on the competition website. All the information in the “Events” tab will also be found there.

After you have followed all the steps and double-checked that everything is correct, scroll to the bottom of the competition form and click “Confirm”. This button is unavailable to Trainee Delegates. This action will send an email notification to all Delegates of the competition, the Senior Delegate, and the WCAT. This email is used to notify the WCAT that your competition is ready to be reviewed. It could take up to 48 hours before you receive a reply. This email thread will then be the official announcement thread of the competition when you need to make any changes. Do not add anyone to this thread unless you have a compelling reason for it. You are not allowed to add the organizers to this thread unless the organizers are other WCA Volunteers who have a good reason to be added.

### Requesting a Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competition

A Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competition is a competition taking place in different venues at the same time. At such a competition, **only** 3x3x3 Fewest Moves is held, and all competitors at all locations get the same scrambles at the same time. These competitions are made to make it easier for competitors to compete in a less popular event that is not regularly held.

There are differences in the WCRP that apply to Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competitions. These competitions may be held as long as none of the locations are closer than 10 kilometers to a regular competition. Exceptions may be made if both competitions are at least 5 days apart or the other competition does not have 3x3x3 Fewest Moves as an event.

Remember these points when requesting a Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competition. The following points either supersede the listed points for regular competitions or are additions to the regular competition form:

- Set the coordinates of the competition to one of the listed venues or to a location that has a special meaning to the region where the Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competition is taking place. Worldwide competitions must be set to (0, 0).
- The city must be listed as “Multiple cities”.
- The address must be listed as “Multiple locations”.
- The locations of every venue **must** be individually set under the “Manage schedule” tab. Mock locations are not allowed in this section.
- Include “Fewest Moves” or “FMC” in the name of the competition to further stress that it is a Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competition.
- There must be a place on the competition website (e.g. a tab on the WCA website) that clearly displays all of the addresses for the different locations and who will be the official Delegate of that venue. Include additional location-specific information on that tab, such as a specific entry fee or competitor limit for a specific location. When there are different competitor limits for the different locations, this must be written in the Extra Registration Requirements.
- Every Delegate at a location must be listed as official Delegates of the competition.
- The latest deadline to add a new location is 28 days before the competition.
- An address may be listed as “To be decided” until 14 days before the start of the competition.
- There must not be a competitor limit for the entire competition. However, each individual location may have its own competitor limit.
- If there are different time zones for the different locations, include in the schedule at what local time the competition will start in each location. The time zones must be adjusted so that all competitors will be doing their attempts simultaneously.

### Making Changes to an Existing Competition

Every request for changes to an existing competition must be made using “Reply All” on the same email thread that was created when you confirmed the competition. The email thread will include all listed Delegates of the competition, the Senior and Regional Delegates for the competition’s region, and the WCA Competition Announcements Team (WCAT) in the CC field.

To add a Delegate, reply-all to the email thread, add the new Delegate to the CC field of the email, and ask, “Could we add \<Delegate Name\> (\<WCA ID\>) as a Delegate for this competition?”. Then, wait for WCAT approval. Follow the same process to remove a Delegate.

To request a change to the list of organizers, include their names and their WCA IDs. Organizers must have an account to be listed.

Changing the list of events:

- Addition of events: at least five calendar days prior to the competition, ask for adding the event as an official event of the competition. In the request, explain why you would like the event to be added. The WCAT will then review your request. If the request is approved, they will add the events to the list of official events of the competition. After that is done, you need to write an email to the WCAT with all competitors in the BCC field, informing them of this change and offering to have the event included in their registration. Once approved, update the schedule on the competition website.
- Removal of events: ask for the removal of the event from the list of official events of the competition. In the request, explain the reason for the removal of the event. After approval, you will need to update the competition schedule on the website. After this is done, you need to write an email to all competitors with the WCAT in the BCC field to make them aware of the change.

Closing/extending the registration period:

- If you need to close registration earlier than expected, you may do so via the button on the top of the “organizer view” section of the competition website. If you want to close registration before the competitor limit has been filled, you may do so by emailing the WCAT with a request and explanation.
- Extending the registration period: write an email on the competition thread and ask for an extension. The email must include the closing time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and the date. You must also write the reasons for the extension. Having fewer registrations than expected is a valid reason.
- Additional registration periods must be announced at least 24 hours before they are scheduled to start. The request must be written to the WCAT with times and dates in UTC. Having fewer registrations than expected is a valid reason to re-open registration. This approach may also be used to propose on-the-spot (OTS) registration.

Increasing the competitor limit:

- Delegates may request a change to the competitor limit of a competition by providing a valid reason. Potential reasons for increasing the competitor limit are that you have a larger venue than initially expected, the competitor-to-guest ratio is lower than expected, or that you chose a competitor limit that was too low. Do not increase the competitor limit if there is the possibility of the venue being crammed. Registrations must **never** be accepted before the WCAT approves the limit increase.

## Managing Registrations

It is the organization team’s responsibility to manage competition registrations. However, Delegates must ensure that the organizers are following through with this responsibility. Regularly confirm the following:

- New registrations are being approved.
- Only competitors who have paid for registration are being accepted, excluding those exempt from registration fees according to point 1.3 of the [Code of Ethics](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf).
- Organizers are accepting registrations in the order of registration and not showing favoritism or exclusionary practices based on any factor.
- Refunds are being handled, especially when your competition allows registrants to delete their own registrations.
- First-time competitors have their names capitalized and formatted correctly.
- All registration requirements and deadlines you have set are being followed.
- No registered competitors are on the [Banned Competitors list](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/panel/Delegate#banned-competitors).
  - If a competitor who is banned registers for a competition, contact the WIC immediately.

Watch for registrations that seem to have mistakes. It is common for a first-time competitor to mistakenly register for the inverse of their intended events, such as every event except 3x3x3 Cube. Contact the competitor to verify their event selection before the competition. You are also permitted to edit their registration to fix presumed mistakes, but be careful not to unregister the competitor for events that they intend to participate in. If such a mistake is not caught, you may allow the competitor to compete in events they did not register for per [Regulation A7g](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A7g).

### Administering Registration Data

Take special care while handling registration data. Problems with registration data can often be easily clarified when talking to the affected competitor during the competition but are significantly harder to solve after the competition. Carefully look through the registration data at least once before the competition. You may send a competitor an email to correct their registration information or fix this information at the check-in table. You will review registration data again when submitting results in the [Double-checking Registration Data](#double-checking-registration-data) section.

Below are the most common issues with registration data:

- Ensure that every name is correctly capitalized and complete (see below).
- Ensure that everyone has registered with reasonable dates of birth (e.g. not 1900-01-01 or a date in the current year).

On abbreviations in competitor names:

- Competitor names are required to contain a full last name as noted on a person’s legal document and a reasonable first name or nickname.
- The name of the competitor must be Roman-readable. Competitors are allowed to have a locally written name if they wish. The localized version must be surrounded by parentheses and added after the Roman-readable name. Example: Hanako Yamada (山田映奈子).
- Double-letter abbreviations (e.g. “AJ” and “TJ”) are permitted as a first or middle name if a competitor wishes to be called accordingly.
- Single letter abbreviations (e.g. “A.”, “B.”) for first and last names are not permitted unless this is how the name is displayed on an ID document.
- First name single letter abbreviations are **only** permitted when a reasonable nickname or middle name is also provided. Example: A. Bob Smith.
- Second first names and middle names may be abbreviated if they wish.
- Competitors who prefer to be called by their second first name are permitted to use this as their first name.
- Apart from the above abbreviation cases, no additional punctuation or symbols may be added to a name unless that is how it appears in an ID document.

The examples below are permitted:

- “John J. Doe”
- “John James Doe”
- “James Doe”
- “JJ Doe”
- “J. James Doe”

The examples below are **not** permitted:

- “J. J. Doe”
- “John James D.”
- “J. J. D.”

## Communicating with Competitors and their Families

It is generally a good idea to send emails to competitors before the competition to encourage them to make the necessary updates to their registration and remind them to plan for the competition. This is the organization team’s responsibility, but as a Delegate, you must ensure that the organizers are following through with this responsibility. Remember to **always use the BCC field in communications with multiple competitors** so that other competitor emails are not shared. The WCA website will automatically add all recipients to the BCC field if you email them by checking the box next to their registration on the Registration page of the competition website and then clicking the “Email” button. If there is a data breach, **you must** contact the WRT as soon as possible and explain the situation.

See the Organizer Guidelines for more [information on emailing competitors](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/edudoc/organizer-guidelines/emails.pdf).

## Generating Scrambles

To generate scrambles:

1. **Download and install TNoodle**. You _must_ use the latest version of TNoodle. [You can download TNoodle here.](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles/)
2. **Adjust the number of scramble sets on the competition website**. This can be found at `https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/<competition-id>/events/edit`.
    1. Most of the time, it is a good idea to create an extra scramble set for each round for each event. It is a little more work to adjust it here and then remove them when preparing results, but it is easier to have extra scramble sets readily available when a significant incident occurs rather than having to generate new scramble sets on the fly.
3. **Open TNoodle**, which launches a page in your web browser, and log in by authorizing it to use your WCA account and select the competition on the left.
4. **Generate Scrambles**. Verify the number of scramble sets is correct and provide a secure password that will be used to protect the `.zip` file that is created. Click the “Generate Scrambles” button. The scramble generation process can take some time. When finished, the button will be named “Download Scrambles”. Click it to download the `.zip` file to a location on your computer. **Do not lose this file** since you will need it when matching the scrambles to the results after the competition. It is a good idea to back this up to a secondary storage device or an online cloud service in case of hardware failure.
5. **Get Files.** Using the password from the previous step, unarchive the `.zip` file. This file will contain the following files related to scramble generation and result submission:
    1. `Interchange`, which is used when compiling results after the competition. This file contains the full scramble information for the competition in various formats.
    2. `pdfs`, which contains the scrambles for the competition in a **password-protected** PDF file. These are the same files that are contained in the Computer Display `.zip` file (see below).
    3. `Printing`, which contains the scrambles for the competition in **unprotected** PDF files and is designed for use when printing the scrambles onto paper.
        1. As this folder contains all scrambles for the competition in an unprotected format, be very careful when handling this file. **This file must be inaccessible to scramblers using scramble display devices.**
        2. Printing scrambles is highly discouraged under regular circumstances due to the increased risk of a breach in scramble secrecy. If you must print scrambles, ensure they are always kept secure and only accessible to Delegates at all times.
    4. `<competition-name> - Computer Display PDF Passcodes - SECRET`, which contains the passcodes to open the scramble set PDFs for each round. Only share this file with the Delegates of the competition.
        1. Optionally, input the contents of this into https://simonkellly.github.io/scramble-organizer/. You can then create a list in your note-taking app of choice, such as Google Keep, and the passwords will be sorted according to the competition schedule.
    5. `<competition-name> - Computer Display PDFs.zip`, which is an archive of the corresponding **password-protected** PDFs. Share this with the other Delegates who will display them on laptops or other scramble display devices for scrambling during the competition. **These must be the only accessible scramble-related files on any device that is used for displaying scrambles**.

When delegating a competition, you only need the Computer Display PDFs and their associated passcodes. To prevent accidental leaks of scramble information, do not bring any of the other files to the competition.

## Generating Groups

It is the organization team’s responsibility to generate groups. However, it is the Delegate’s responsibility to ensure they are fair and consistent. The following events are considered highly scramble-dependent, as the scramble alone can have a strong impact on who achieves a podium placement or advances to subsequent rounds:

- 3x3x3 Cube
- 2x2x2 Cube
- 3x3x3 Blindfolded
- 3x3x3 One-Handed
- Clock
- Pyraminx
- Skewb
- Square-1

For non-first rounds, it is a good practice to put all of the similarly skilled competitors in one group to ensure that they receive the same scrambles. Use the results of the previous round to determine which groups to place competitors in.

## Competition Cancelation and Rescheduling

Once a competition is announced, it is the expectation and responsibility of the Delegates to commit to seeing the competition through on the original date announced. Competitors and their families will have made arrangements and financial commitments to attend on that day, and it is in everyone’s best interest to honor those commitments.

Cancelations may only happen when there is no safe or feasible alternative. This is only an option in extenuating circumstances such as:

- Extreme weather conditions/natural disasters
- Political unrest or conflict
- Venue facility failures (electrical, plumbing, structural) and finding another venue is unreasonable
- General safety concerns with competitors traveling to or attending the competition

If you encounter issues such as these where canceling a competition appears necessary, do not make any significant changes or statements to competitors. Instead, explain the situation to the WCAT on the competition announcement thread, as they can provide guidance on which options are available to prevent competition cancelation. Here are examples of some preventative measures that could be taken:

- If a listed Delegate can no longer attend due to an emergency, the WCA Board may appoint an experienced and trusted Community member as a temporary Delegate if no other Delegates are available. In this case, take the following steps:

1. “Reply All” to the competition announcement thread and add the WCA Board to the CC field.
2. Explain why you are no longer able to attend and whom you propose as a temporary Delegate.
3. The Board will vote on whether to appoint this person and respond with any concerns.

- For financial concerns, such as low registration turnout, the WCAT could involve the WFC to analyze potential solutions. Remember that Delegates are responsible for reviewing the budget prior to the competition announcement and having a plan in the event of unexpectedly low income. Organizing should be done through a Regional Organization or a similar legal entity whenever possible to protect individuals from liability and always have backup funds available. Competitions are unlikely to be canceled solely over a budget deficit. Contact the WFC at the soonest indication that a budget deficit poses a significant risk to the competition for assistance in resolving the situation.

# Day of the Competition {.page-break-before}

Your presence as a Delegate at a competition allows it to be WCA-recognized. Your responsibility is to ensure that it follows the standards put forth by the WCA.

## Setup and Environment

Regardless of whether the organization team or venue employees are setting up the competition room, ensure that the competition layout abides by the WCA Regulations. These Regulations are outlined in [Article 7: Environment](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-7-environment). In addition, [Regulation 1c](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#1c) outlines that your competition must follow all applicable WCA policies and requirements. This includes the [WCA Scramble Accountability Policy](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Scramble%20Accountability.pdf). If the Regulations cannot be followed, the competition results risk being retroactively removed. Review the competition setup and make any changes necessary to make it fully compliant with WCA policies. Pay especially close attention to zoning. The scrambling area must be visually isolated from all areas that could have competitors not involved in organizing or scrambling the ongoing group.

## Check-In and Registration

Most competitions will have a check-in or registration table. Place this table close to the main entrance of the competition room so that competitors entering can easily pick up any necessary materials for the competition, such as a name tag and lanyard. Only exclude a check-in table if the competition is very small, has few or no first-time competitors, and you are confident you can easily identify every competitor without a check-in table.

### On-the-Spot Registration

You might receive questions regarding on-the-spot registration at the competition. You may register a competitor for the competition on the spot under these circumstances. (Exceptions could apply if other formats, shown in the next section, are used.):

1. Competitors must not be accepted on the day of the competition under any circumstances unless on-the-spot registration for the competition is enabled.
2. If registration is full, on-the-spot registrations _must not_ be accepted on the day of the competition.

Some regions have created alternative waiting list formats that maximize the number of competitors who compete and reduce no-shows. The Extra Registration Requirements must clearly outline these policies to be allowed. Here are some examples of acceptable formats that have been approved in the past when the process was explicitly outlined in the Extra Registration Requirements:

1. Competitors on the waiting list are added in the order of the waiting list after the waiting list deadline if the conditions are specified.
2. Competitors attempting to register on the spot when registration is full may be added on the day of the competition in the order of arrival when on-the-spot registration is enabled if the conditions are specified.
    1. On-the-spot registrations must not be accepted before competitors on the waiting list unless otherwise specified.
3. If an online waiting list is not used and registration is full, competitors attempting to register on the spot may be added on the day of the competition in the order of arrival when on-the-spot registration is enabled, if specified.
4. Other policies may be accepted at the discretion of the WCAT.

Above all, the competitor limit must not be exceeded for any reason. Competitor limits will not be increased after a competition if registrations are accepted beyond the specified limit.

### Verifying First-Time Competitors

Verify the identity of every first-time competitor at their first competition, according to [Regulation 2e](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#2e) and [Guideline 2e++](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#2e++). It is recommended to include a “First-Time Competitor Information” tab on every WCA competition page with instructions for all first-time competitors to bring some form of identification to verify their full name, date of birth, and country of representation. Forms of identification include, but are not limited to, passports, birth certificates, and school ID cards. A check-in table is a perfect place to verify this information, so assign a trusted competition volunteer or Delegate to manage the check-in process and verify this information.

Printouts with private information, such as a first-time competitor checklist with dates of birth, must remain private and **never** be left unattended at a check-in table. Instruct competition volunteers with a sensitive printout so they do not lose sight of it and do not show it to anyone other than the competition volunteers.

When checking in a first-time competitor, verify the following information:

- Name, including spelling and capitalization
  - Have the competitor view their written name to confirm that it is correct. Pre-printed name tags are a great way to do this.
- Date of birth
- Country
  - According to [Regulation 2e](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#2e), competitors must represent a country where they hold citizenship. Take additional caution when verifying a competitor’s country of registration, as many competitors will mistakenly indicate their country of residence or heritage.
- They have never competed at a WCA competition before

If a first-time competitor does not have a form of identification available, it is acceptable to allow the competitor to verbally confirm their name and date of birth. If they cannot provide a document proving citizenship, make a note for this competitor and inform them to send the documentation to you via email after the competition. Competitors without any citizenship may compete as “Stateless” under [Regulation 2e3](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#2e3). Contact the WCA Results Team (WRT) if you encounter such a competitor.

## First-Time Competitor Tutorial

A first-time competitor is recommended to help reduce incidents when there are first-time competitors at your competition. Most first-time competitor tutorials take 10-20 minutes and are held at the start of a competition. Depending on your competition schedule, you could hold the new competitor tutorial at another time during the competition to maximize its impact.

- If the first event of the competition is unlikely to have many first-time competitors, you may choose to delay it until right before the first first-time competitor-friendly event, as some first-time competitors might not be present for events they are not competing in.
- If there is a day when few first-time competitors are expected, such as a day focused on blindfolded events, you could skip the tutorial entirely and hold it on another day.
- If there are potentially multiple days that a first-time competitor could attend for the first time, consider holding multiple first-time competitor tutorials on each day of the competition.

A Delegate is usually the best suited for running a first-time competitor tutorial because of their familiarity with the Regulations. When the Delegate does not speak the local language, you could choose an organizer or trusted competitor to deliver the tutorial. If there are many first-time competitors, it might be best to have multiple separate tutorials so that everyone can see and hear their tutorial more easily.

The following points are an outline of a first-time competitor tutorial for a WCA competition. Depending on the specific events of the competition, it might be a good idea to have a secondary judging tutorial before an event that has specific judging instructions. For example, 3x3x3 Blindfolded judging does not have the judge time the inspection phase and has them hold a sight blocker. In the Clock event, competitors are allowed to manipulate the pins during the inspection, judges must check both sides of the puzzle, and the puzzle does not have any +2 misalignment penalties. Modify the tutorial as necessary to fit the needs of your competition.

- How to read a nametag, or otherwise determine the competitor’s competing, judging, scrambling, and/or running groups.
- What to do when the competitor’s group is called.
- How to compete:
  - Telling the judge they are ready.
  - Inspection time, including penalties.
  - How to start the timer properly:
    - Hand position, particularly using fingers to start the timer.
    - Waiting for the green light on the timer.
  - How to stop the timer properly:
    - Flat hands (e.g. no “karate chops”).
  - How to sign for attempts.
    - Check that the time matches the timer and is written legibly. Times that are not written legibly will be interpreted in the worst way possible. Competitors are allowed to ask their judge to re-write times if they are hard to read.
  - How to call over a Delegate.
- How to judge:
  - Asking the competitor whether they are ready and waiting for the competitor’s ready signal.
  - Judging the inspection, including lifting the puzzle cover, operating the stopwatch, and making callouts.
    - Emphasize that only “8 seconds” and “12 seconds” are called out, not 15 or 17 seconds.
    - Emphasize that they should only stop the stopwatch when the competitor starts their solve so that the actual time of the inspection is measured.
  - What to look for when the competitor starts their solve, including:
    - Timer start hand position.
    - Whether the competitor is touching the puzzle.
  - How to judge during the solve:
    - Pay attention. Do not cube, use your phone, or engage in conversation.
    - Do not distract the competitor during the solve. Sit still and be quiet.
    - Watch the competitor for any Regulations violations.
    - Pay close attention to how the competitor stops their timer.
        - Ensure they are using their hands with palms flat and facing down.
  - Finishing the solve.
    - The first step is to evaluate whether the cube is solved.
        - Do not touch the puzzle. Use only your eyes.
    - How to evaluate the cube for +2s:
        - Explain that a single turn (e.g. U or U') is a +2 penalty on an NxNxN puzzle.
        - Explain that a “double move” (e.g. U2 or R2) is also a +2 penalty and not considered two separate moves.
        - Explain that a slice move (e.g. M or M2) is considered two outer moves and is thus a DNF.
        - Tell them that if the cube is close to the limit for a +2 penalty (e.g. 45 degrees on NxNxN puzzles), and the judge cannot determine the final state, they should call over a Delegate to make the final decision.
    - Explain that a corner twist is a DNF.
    - Explain how missing pieces affect the solved state.
        - The complexity of Regulation 5b5 can make this difficult for competitors to understand. Emphasize that judges may call over a Delegate if they are uncertain about how to rule specific missing pieces.
    - How to write the final time.
        - Emphasize legible handwriting.
    - How to write the final time when there are penalties.
    - Ask the competitor to sign for the attempt.
  - What to do after the attempt is over. This can vary depending on how your competition is being run.

## Competing as a Delegate

If you are competing at a competition you are delegating, there are some things that you must remember.

### Conduct

Even while competing, you are still representing the WCA as a Delegate. A listed Delegate at a competition is still a Delegate while they are competing. A solo Delegate still needs to be able to handle incidents arising from other competitors, even if they are competing in the round in which the incident occurred.

If there are multiple **listed** Delegates at the competition, avoid having all of them compete at the same time whenever possible. If you are a solo Delegate, but there are some **unlisted** Delegates at the competition, you should communicate with them and temporarily pass off incident-handling responsibilities while you are competing to minimize the risk of causing incidents for yourself during the round.

If there are no other Delegates at the competition, you may appoint an organizer as an incident handler per [Regulation 1c](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#1c). It is best to explicitly list out the responsibilities you are granting to a person appointed this way, such as: “You may make +2 penalty calls and grant extra attempts during incidents until the end of this group. When I am done, explain any Delegate calls you made to me”. As the Delegate, you are ultimately accountable for how these responsibilities are carried out, so it is important to review every Delegate call by an appointed individual.

Follow the same rules for yourself that you would apply to other competitors while competing, particularly on matters surrounding scramble secrecy. While competing, remain in the designated competition or waiting areas, do not interact with the scrambling table, and avoid handling incidents on scrambles in your group that you have not yet seen.

### Your Own Incidents

If an incident occurs to you while you are competing, you must be cautious when granting an extra attempt to yourself. Although Delegates are authorized to grant extra attempts to themselves, it could appear unfair to other competitors. Have a higher bar for granting extra attempts to yourself. For example, have a higher tolerance to sudden noises than the average competitor and only grant yourself an extra attempt when there is an exceptional distraction. If there are other Delegates at this competition, call them over to grant the extra attempt whenever possible. If there are no other Delegates available, call over a trusted and experienced Community member to verify the reasonableness of the extra attempt and demonstrate transparency.

Generally, Delegates do not grant extra attempts to themselves for being distracted by another competitor calling “Delegate”. Such distractions happen often enough that it is unreasonable for a Delegate to not expect such calls during their solves. If such calls are distracting, take steps to increase your noise isolation by wearing non-electronic earmuffs or earplugs.

## Score-taking

Score-taking involves entering the results from the score sheets into WCA Live or another score-taking software. These results are later submitted to the WCA database. Score-taking must be performed at every competition by a trusted person.

As a Delegate, you are ultimately responsible for the results that are entered and submitted. It is a good idea to keep up with score-taking during the competition as much as possible, including double-checking results after they are entered. This will ensure that the correct individuals are advancing to the subsequent rounds, as the results of competitors who would otherwise erroneously advance to a subsequent round get caught and corrected.

When assigning someone to do score-taking using WCA Live, **do not let them use your WCA account**. Instead, add the user as a score taker under the competition settings on WCA Live and make them log in with their own WCA account.

If you are logging into WCA Live on a device that does not belong to you, you are **strongly** encouraged to use the one-time code sign-in method for security reasons. Typing your password on a device that you do not control is a simple way for a person to steal your WCA account’s login credentials. **Do not use the one-time code to allow someone else to log into your account. Instead, add their account as a score taker, as mentioned above**. Since your WCA account gives you access to the personal information of hundreds of thousands of users, never allow another person to access or use your WCA account.

### Common Score-taking Issues

<!---
Using an HTML table here because Markdown formatters and renderers often cannot present the information in a way that is easy to read when editing.
-->

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>**Issue**</td>
    <td>**Resolution**</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Time is not written clearly.</td>
    <td>
    [Guideline A7c+](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#A7c+) states that you must ensure the time is clearly written and correctly formatted. Interpret any ambiguous numbers in the worst reasonable way.</br></br>
    It is preferable that final results reflect the correct results instead of what is recorded due to an inattentive competitor or judge. With sufficient evidence (e.g. a video of the attempt with a clear view of the final timer display), enter the actual time that occurred regardless of the ambiguity of the score sheet.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DNS result is recorded on score sheet.</td>
    <td>Sometimes, judges  mistakenly write “DNS” on the score sheet when the competitor fails to start the timer correctly or other pre-solve issues. DNS results are only given when the competitor is eligible for an attempt but decides to forfeit it. If a judge writes a result as a DNS and you cannot verify that the attempt is a genuine DNS, it is safer to change the result to DNF.</br></br>
    One or more sequential DNS results at the end of a score sheet are much more likely to be genuine than a DNS followed by valid times.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Competitor did not sign for an attempt.</td>
    <td>If the competition is not over, you may call over the competitor to sign for the attempt after the fact per [Regulation A7c5](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A7c5). Otherwise, enter the attempt as a DNF. You must not use video or photographic evidence in place of a missing signature.</br></br>
    Entering a DNF result for a missing signature often prompts the competitor to appear once they check their results on WCA Live. You may still allow the competitor to sign for the attempt at your discretion.</br></br>
    For inexperienced competitors, additional leniency is permitted per [Regulation A7c8](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A7c8). You may allow missing signatures to be added at any time.

The judge must be the same judge who actually judged that attempt. Another person must not sign as the judge for the attempt. If the judge cannot be quickly identified, you could ask the competitor to look for the judge and bring them to you. Otherwise, input the time as a DNF.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Records and Notable Solves

When a world record, continental record, or an otherwise notable solve occurs, it is strongly recommended to review the scrambles with the competitor to verify that they received the correct scramble, as [Regulation 11i1](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#11i1) requires any misscrambles on these solves to be replaced with an extra attempt. Note: For 5x5x5, 6x6x6, 7x7x7, and Megaminx, this is unnecessary according to [Regulation 11i1e](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#11i1e). If the competitor’s solve was filmed, request to review the footage of every attempt and check that the scrambles match the expected scrambles.

If no footage is available, ask the competitor to reconstruct their solve from the correct scramble. Top cubers are generally able to recognize scrambles they previously received and reconstruct them, especially for shorter events. A record-breaking solution is likely to also be rather lucky, so remember whether the reconstruction provided by the competitor seems realistic. If the competitor is unable to reconstruct the solution, it is a sign that they might not have received the correct scramble.

If a misscramble is found for an attempt under the criteria in [Regulation 11i1](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#11i1) during the competition, no matter how closely it resembles the correct scramble, grant an extra attempt to replace it.

#### World Record Social Media Posts

World records are one of the biggest ways the WCA reaches and engages the public. When a world record occurs, Delegates are encouraged to fill out the [World Record Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLrkLhFnIy1QNGoWoZT4jsOIibNJ_xc9qTd_YKBpcuMIq-LA/viewform). The form is sent to the WCA Communication Team (WCT), who can make posts about the new world record on the WCA’s social media pages. An example of a world-record post can be found [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3tazeXN9ZO/).

When a new world record is achieved, a lot of attention is directed toward the WCA. These world-record social media posts are most effective when they are posted during this excitement. Fill out the form as soon as the record has been verified by checking the scrambles, validating the score sheets, and resolving any possible incidents.

Before submitting a photo of the competitor through the form, you must obtain the competitor’s consent to share the photo on the WCA’s social media pages.

### Missing Competitor Results

When the results for a round are fully entered, you might have competitors without results. The most likely reason for this is that they did not compete, but it is good to verify this. Losing a competitor’s results leads to a poor competitor experience.

Score sheets that are pre-labeled with the competitor’s name are always highly recommended, as a blank score sheet with the competitor’s name after the round is complete is strong evidence that the competitor did not compete. Once you have their blank score sheet, you may safely quit them from the round in WCA Live. If a blank score sheet cannot be found, it is likely that their score sheet was misplaced. Sometimes, score sheets get stuck together or lost inside puzzle covers. Sometimes, the competitor will take the score sheet without realizing its importance in score-taking. If you cannot locate a score sheet and the competitor can verify that they did their attempts, grant the competitor provisional extra attempts for the entire round and enter those results. If the original score sheet reappears, replace the provisional extra attempts with the original results. When granting provisional extra attempts in this scenario, you should explain to the competitor how this process works.

## Penalties

A competitor or judge should call over a Delegate when they are unable to determine whether the resting state of a puzzle at the end of the solve is a penalty. This usually occurs when the puzzle is very close to the halfway threshold for misalignment penalties. Observe the puzzle from multiple angles and use multiple pieces as reference points to try and determine the most accurate ruling. If you still cannot determine the penalty state, this is generally considered no penalty, as the sub-Regulations of [Regulation 10f](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#10f) state maximum offset amounts, and a resting state on the threshold of the penalty does not explicitly exceed that limit.

Finally, remember that a penalty is not considered an incident. Penalties correctly applied to solves fully follow the Regulations as stated. For more information on what is considered an incident, see the Incidents section.

#### Square-1 Misalignments

Square-1 misalignments are handled slightly differently from other puzzles. Although [Regulation 10e1](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#10e1) defines +2 penalties as requiring one additional move to solve, the metric for misalignments overrides the metric for moves per [Guideline 10e1+](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#10e1+). The misalignment thresholds for Square-1 are at most 45 degrees (U/D) or 90 degrees (/).

One side effect of these Regulations is that there are some Square-1 states that could appear to be a DNF at first glance but are actually only a +2 misalignment penalty. The most extreme case of this is in the following image:

![](images/sq1-plus-2.jpg){.centered width=50%}

In this example, a (1, 0) / (-1, -1) and then a partial slice under 90 degrees have been applied to the puzzle. This is only a +2 misalignment penalty because the (1, 0) is under the misalignment threshold of 45 degrees for (U, D) moves, and so is not a DNF. The slice is over the misalignment threshold of 90 degrees and incurs a +2 penalty. The (-1, -1) once again is under the misalignment threshold, as U and D moves are considered separately according to [Guideline 10f4+](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#10f4+). Finally, the partial slice is under the 90-degree threshold. In conclusion, only one move has been made above the penalty threshold, so the final ruling is that this is a +2 penalty.

## Regulation 3j: Reasonable Wear

[Regulation 3j](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#3j) defines what is considered reasonable wear for a puzzle to be used in a competition. To increase the consistency in how reasonable wear is evaluated, the WRC has created a [Regulation 3j Visual Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6THsA8fXRN7QFM4ApJbm6eVODKGbMLx/view) to assist Delegates in making rulings regarding wear. Familiarize yourself with the examples included in the guide. Some cases of wear will not perfectly match the provided examples. Make your best judgment by extrapolating from these examples. If there is doubt about the legality of a puzzle, it is safest to request that a competitor use a different puzzle to prevent their results from being retroactively removed.

If an illegal puzzle is found during a round, any completed attempts may be replaced with extra attempts at your discretion per [Regulation 3k2a](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#3k2a). If the round has already been completed, these attempts must not be replaced with extra attempts. An example of this is when an illegal puzzle is first noticed during a second round and then discovered to have also been used in the first round. Exception: for inexperienced competitors, extra attempts may be granted after the round is complete per [Regulation A7g](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A7g) but must be granted if a subsequent round has started per [Regulation 9l](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#9l).

## Regulation 5b5: Popped Puzzles

[Regulation 5b5](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#5b5) is one of the most notoriously difficult Regulations to apply due to the vast number of final resting states and ambiguous ways pieces are not properly attached. When you encounter a difficult-to-rule resting state of the final puzzle, refer to the [Regulation 5b5 Visual Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15XszaCGNvy3Dk6X6qERzZWZaDH1RH04z/view) to help you make the final decision.

## Incidents

One of a Delegate’s primary responsibilities at a competition is resolving incidents. [Regulation 11a](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#11a) and its sub-Regulations clarify what is considered an incident. Regulations [11b](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#11b) and [11d](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#11d) outline the course of action expected of any Delegate and are among the most important responsibilities of a Delegate at a competition. As a Delegate, your goal is to resolve incidents while considering the fairness of the final resolutions.

### Extra Attempts

Extra attempts are often granted to competitors to resolve incidents that prevent them from being unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. Always consider fairness when granting an extra attempt, as some competitors might try to take advantage of extra attempts to replace a bad solve. Use your discretion when granting an extra attempt. If you believe a competitor is taking advantage of an incident by requesting an extra attempt, you may reject their request.

When an incident arises during an attempt, encourage competitors to stop the attempt immediately by calling over a Delegate with the timer still running. A competitor who completes the solve then has the option to determine whether the attempt is a bad result before requesting an extra attempt, effectively giving them a second shot at the attempt. According to [Guideline 11e+++](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#11e+++), use stronger discretion when granting an extra attempt after the solve has finished. Only grant the extra attempt in exceptional circumstances. However, remember that it could be difficult for a competitor to pause mid-attempt for short events. Consider the length of the attempt when evaluating whether to grant an extra attempt and be less lenient for events longer than a few seconds.

The following is a general decision tree for handling incidents. It should give you a general idea of what to consider and the typical outcome of an incident. However, **this decision tree is always welcome to be overruled by the Delegate when they believe their decision is more fair**.

![](images/extra attempt-decision-tree.png){.centered width=90%}

#### Provisional Extra Attempts

You may grant a provisional extra attempt if you are uncertain of the fairness of giving an extra attempt or do not have time to thoroughly investigate the circumstances around an incident. A provisional extra attempt is an extra attempt that is not guaranteed to be accepted as the final result. Communicate to the competitor that you are granting a provisional extra attempt and explain that you will determine at a future time whether the original time or the time from the provisional extra attempt will stand.

If the provisional extra attempt determines whether a person advances to a subsequent round, you may choose to allow the affected competitor to also compete provisionally. Inform them that their attempts for the subsequent rounds are provisional and could be invalidated depending on the final result of the other competitor’s provisional extra attempt. Take caution when exercising this option, as it could confuse the affected competitors. Additionally, if this situation occurs more than once in a competition, rule every instance similarly to be fair to all competitors at that competition.

At any point, you may re-evaluate the fairness of the provisional extra attempt and make a final ruling on whether it counts for the official attempt. However, if you are still uncertain about a final ruling, describe the incident in the Incidents section of the Delegate Report and request WRC feedback. They will review the situation and provide a final ruling on whether to keep the provisional extra attempt.

### Regulation A7g

Many first-time competitors will inadvertently break the Regulations due to their unfamiliarity with the Regulations and processes of a WCA competition or an event’s specific Regulations. In these cases, you are always encouraged to use [Regulation A7g](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A7g) to grant an extra attempt to these competitors. An inexperienced competitor might not necessarily be new to WCA competitions, such as a competitor who is returning to WCA competitions after a long time or a competitor who is unfamiliar with a specific event ([Guideline A7g++++](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#A7g++++)). For example, a blindfolded-focused competitor who is newly competing in other speedsolving events might not be used to the judge lifting the puzzle cover for them. Use your discretion when granting extra attempts for incidents like these.

According to [Guideline A7g++](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#A7g++), Delegates must not apply Regulation A7g to waive penalties.
A Delegate may grant an extra attempt to an A7g-eligible competitor who gets a +2 penalty due to unfamiliarity with the Regulations. However, a +2 penalty alone is insufficient to justify granting an extra attempt to a first-time competitor, as this would effectively be an additional attempt that replaces a poor result. There must be extenuating circumstances, such as confusion about the Regulations, to grant an extra attempt for an attempt that incurred a +2 penalty.

### Common Incidents

The following incidents occur frequently at competitions and have a standard way of getting resolved:

<!-- Using an HTML table here because Markdown formatters and renderers often cannot present the information in a way that is easy to read when editing -->

  <tr>
    <td>**Incident**</td>
    <td>**Resolution**</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Judge did not reset timer.</td>
    <td>
    [Regulation A3b](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A3b) indicates the judge is responsible for resetting the timer. Therefore, the competitor is not considered at fault for this incident. Grant an extra attempt, remind the judge to ensure the timer is reset before any attempt, and inform the competitor for future reference that they are allowed to reset the timer during the inspection phase if they notice it is not reset.</br></br>
    If the competitor repeatedly fails to notice that the timer is not reset, especially within a single round, you may use your discretion not to grant an extra attempt.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Timer was in 4-pad mode.</td>
    <td>
    [Regulation 7f4](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#7f4) specifies that the timer must be in 2-pad mode. Changing modes on a Gen 5 timer takes several seconds, so it is unreasonable to expect the competitor to switch modes during the inspection phase. Grant an extra attempt and inform the judge and competitor to check the color of the light. An orange light indicates 2-pad mode. A blue light indicates 4-pad mode.</br></br>
    Timers occasionally malfunction and switch to 4-pad mode on their own. When this happens, make a note of which timer had the issue and replace it if the issue continues to persist. Consider whether the specific timer has recently malfunctioned when granting an extra attempt to a competitor for a potential timer malfunction.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Duplicate scramble reported.</td>
    <td>
    [Regulation 11j](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#11j) specifies what to do when a competitor reports a duplicate scramble.</br></br>
    Do your best to give them the correct scramble. Grant an extra attempt if the correct scramble cannot be confidently determined.</br></br>
    If the competitor has video footage or has not solved the puzzle, you may identify which scramble was given and use that information to resolve the incident. You may request to see the video footage from competitors or inspect competitors’ unsolved puzzles.</br></br>
    When a competitor gets a duplicate scramble, the most likely situation is that the scramblers gave either the previous or current scramble twice. You should be able to reasonably determine which situation is more likely by giving the competitor the correct scramble. If they report another duplicate, give them the previous scramble. If neither scramble resolves the incident, give the competitor an extra attempt.</br></br>
    A competitor could incorrectly report a scramble as a duplicate, which could happen when scrambles share similar features. If this occurs, you may grant an extra attempt if you believe the competitor reported the duplicate in good faith. Otherwise, you may disqualify the attempt.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Revealed puzzle was not the competitor’s.</td>
    <td>
    If the score sheet belongs to the competitor and the competitor has already seen the scramble from a previous attempt, no extra attempt is necessary. If the scramble state is for an attempt the competitor has not yet completed, grant an extra attempt to replace it. Regardless of whether you are granting an extra attempt, try to find the competitor’s actual puzzle before letting them continue their remaining attempts. It is likely with another competitor’s score sheet due to the puzzles getting swapped at the scrambling table or the drop-off table.</br></br>
    If the score sheet belongs to the competitor, warn your scramblers to be more careful when scrambling puzzles.</br></br>
    If the score sheet belongs to another competitor, you should tell the competitor to double-check that their name is on their score sheet before saying they are ready to start their attempt.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Competitor went to wrong solving station.</td>
    <td>An extra attempt is usually granted, but use your discretion if you think the competitor is particularly careless. As a Delegate, you could reduce these cases by creating groups with no duplicate names.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Competitor saw scramble before attempt.</td>
    <td>You may grant an extra attempt depending on exactly how the competitor saw the puzzle. If the competitor accidentally knocked over the puzzle cover themself, the result is a DNF per [Regulation A2e2](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A2e2). If the competitor saw the puzzle as a result of a runner or judge knocking over the puzzle cover or being careless with scramble secrecy, grant an extra attempt. Additionally, you should warn the runner or judge to be more careful to keep puzzles out of sight from competitors.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Judge lifted the puzzle cover before the competitor was ready.</td>
    <td>
    If the competitor did not continue the attempt and immediately called over a Delegate, grant an extra attempt per [Regulation A3b2](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A3b2). However, do not grant an extra attempt if you determine that the competitor might have inspected the puzzle and is asking for an extra attempt after determining that the scramble is bad.</br></br>
    If the competitor has already completed the solve, do not grant an extra attempt, as this would unfairly allow the competitor to determine whether they like the outcome of the attempt before asking for an extra attempt ([incident log](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/incidents/98)).

    <td>Judge did not call “8 seconds” or “12 seconds” after those times had elapsed.</td>
    <td>
    If the competitor has not started the timer, grant an extra attempt. The judge is responsible for making the callouts to inform the competitor of the time elapsed.</br></br>
    You should not grant an extra attempt if the competitor has completed their solve. A competitor who noticed that the judge did not make the callouts should stop the attempt immediately and call a Delegate over. Requesting an extra after the attempt has ended is a sign that they could be trying to replace a poor attempt with a better one.</br></br>
    If the competitor exceeded 15 seconds of inspection time due to the judge not performing callouts, consider whether the competitor received an unfair advantage. Grant an extra attempt if you believe it is likely that the competitor gained an advantage, such as by achieving an uncharacteristically faster time than their other solves. Do not grant an extra attempt if the competitor did not gain an advantage, such as by getting a DNF result or the slowest time in their average, as providing an extra attempt would give the competitor an unfair opportunity to replace a poor result.

    One notable exception to this is when the judge calls out “15 seconds” or “17 seconds”. Although these are invalid callouts according to [Regulations A3b3](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A3b3) and [A3b4](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A3b4), granting an extra attempt in these situations would unfairly allow the competitor to retry an attempt where they could have otherwise received a +2 penalty or a DNF.

For example, “18.” must not be interpreted as “18.99” per [Guideline A7c+](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#A7c+).</br></br>
    If someone other than the competitor reset the timer, or the timer was reset for another reason (e.g. a malfunction), you may use video or photo evidence to record the time. If no video or photo evidence exists, you may grant an extra attempt or use the partially written time in conjunction with [Guideline A7c+](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#A7c+) as the recorded time. Consider fairness. For example, recording a partially written time of “18.8” as “18.89” is fairer than it is to grant an extra attempt. A partially written time of “2” for a competitor averaging 20-30 seconds does not have a reasonable worst interpretation, so grant an extra attempt.

## Competitors Requiring Accommodations

Competitors with circumstances that prevent them from abiding by the WCA Regulations may request special accommodations per [Regulation 2s](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#2s). When the accommodation is related to a disability, provide accommodations relevant to the disability without providing for an advantage that undermines the inherent difficulty of the task. Many accommodations are already explicitly written into the Regulations, so check those first before offering accommodations. Use reasonable discretion when approving accommodations that are not explicitly written. When providing accommodations, perform due diligence to reasonably but not invasively verify the disability.

Examples of accommodations include:

- Colorblind competitors may use stickerless puzzles with colored stickers, bypassing [Regulation 3d](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#3d).
  - Note: [Regulation 3d1](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#3d1) provides some pre-approved accommodations for competitors with visual disabilities.
- Blind competitors using textured puzzles during 3x3x3 One-Handed are allowed to use a second hand to “observe” the puzzle, provided they do not use this second hand to operate it.
- Allowing a competitor to compete in a round on a different day than scheduled, such as when a competitor has religious restrictions that prevent them from attending on a specific day of a multi-day competition.
  - Do not grant accommodations to a competitor who is simply unable to attend on a specific day because of scheduling conflicts.
- Competitors with mobility restrictions may stay at a single solving station (i.e. stationary solving).

Competitors requiring accommodations are encouraged to contact the organization team at least two weeks before the competition. As a Delegate, you are strongly encouraged to accommodate reasonable requests but may decline if the accommodations are infeasible. Contact the WRC if you need assistance determining whether a requested accommodation is appropriate.

## Handling Behavioral Issues

If you encounter disruptive behavior from a competitor or spectator, you need to address it. Always be respectful but assertive when addressing poor behavior. The specifics of any situation vary widely, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution to handling them. The WIC has created a document outlining [Guidelines for Disciplinary Incidents](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/edudoc/guidelines-for-disciplinary-incidents/guidelines-for-disciplinary-incidents.pdf). You should read through the guidelines to familiarize yourself with them.

## Preparing for Subsequent Rounds

If your competition has more than one round of an event, you will need to prepare for the subsequent rounds. Since this is officially the organization team’s responsibility, you can find additional information on preparing for subsequent rounds in the [Organizer Guidelines](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/organizer-guidelines).

As a Delegate, pay special attention when the groups for subsequent rounds are created. In particular, if the subsequent rounds are final rounds or semifinal rounds, make an additional effort to ensure that the competitors most likely to advance to the final round or place on the podium use the same scramble sets. See the [Generating Groups](#generating-groups) section for more information.

## Modifications to the Schedule or Events

If you run behind or ahead of schedule, the organization team might ask about adjusting the schedule of upcoming events to recalibrate with the flow of the competition. When modifying the schedule, you must be aware of several important considerations from the WCA Regulations and the WCRP.

If you decide to modify the details of a competition (e.g. advancement conditions, time limits, cutoffs, or number of rounds), you must update these details on the WCA website and synchronize WCA Live. This will prevent issues with score-taking.

### Running Behind Schedule

Running behind schedule is the most common schedule deviation at WCA competitions. You and the organization team have the following options to try to get the competition back on schedule:

- Continuing the competition as-is and ending later than expected
- Reducing the allotted time for lunch
- Tightening advancement conditions
- Reducing cutoffs or time limits
- Removing rounds

You may change the advancement conditions of a round per [Regulation 9p2a](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#9p2a) and the cutoff and time limits per [Regulation A1a3](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A1a3). In both cases, you must consider the fairness of such a change. When possible, announce any changes before the affected rounds start. Although you may change these details during a round, avoid doing that if possible. [Guideline A1a3+](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#A1a3+) explains how modifications to the time limit or cutoff could disadvantage competitors because it could change the competitor’s strategy.

Removing rounds is permitted, but consider it a last resort tool for getting a competition back on schedule. If removing rounds must be done, prioritize removing smaller subsequent rounds to affect as few competitors as possible. When canceling a planned final for a short event (e.g. 2x2x2 Cube or Pyraminx), try to provide the same scrambles to prospective podium placements by putting the fastest competitors from the previous round in the same group. You are strongly discouraged from removing an event entirely, as providing at least one round of attempts to everyone who signed up for an event is preferable to providing two or more rounds in another event.

### Running Ahead of Schedule

The stakes are lower when you are running ahead of schedule. Simply continuing ahead of schedule will allow for a buffer if there is a delay later in the competition and allows you to leave the venue early if you finish ahead of schedule. Some competitors travel a long way to get to competitions and will appreciate being able to get a head start on their journey home. Alternatively, if it is still the morning, consider extending lunchtime, especially if it is under one hour. Having additional time to get food, eat, relax, and warm up before the competition resumes could greatly improve the competition experience.

If you still want to fill up some time and have longer events with a cutoff time, it is better to increase the cutoff time than to increase the time limit. Competitors usually do not sign up for events they cannot solve within the time limit, and most competitions would not allow them to add events on the day of the competition. Also, increasing the time limit neither significantly increases opportunities for competitors nor substantially extends the duration of the event. Increasing the cutoff time can give some competitors a better chance of getting a full mean or average, resulting in longer rounds. Use your experience with planning competitions to estimate a cutoff time to extend the round by a reasonable amount.

A more drastic option is increasing the number of competitors who advance to a subsequent round. You could also add an additional round. The number of advancing competitors between rounds must still follow the maximum size per [Regulation 9p1](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#9p1). In both cases, remember that some competitors might have already left the venue if they were not expecting to advance to a subsequent round. Unless you have a good reason to expect that the significantity of the competitors who could take advantage of the modified advancement conditions will still be present (e.g. a large second round of a popular event like 3x3x3 Cube still ahead of you in the schedule), generally avoid changing advancement conditions.

Per point 7.4 of the WCRP announcement criteria, you must not add an event to an ongoing WCA competition except as an unofficial event, for which you would need to use a third-party service.

Finally, remember that running ahead of schedule sometimes causes some competitors to arrive late to their assigned groups due to them referencing the online schedule. Do not disqualify competitors for being present at the originally scheduled time. If the same event is still ongoing, adding them to an ongoing or upcoming group should be straightforward. Even if this causes a small delay, being ahead of schedule means you have the buffer time to accommodate the competitor. However, competitors are ultimately responsible for appearing when their group is called, even if the competition is running ahead of schedule. If you feel that accommodating a late competitor is infeasible or otherwise detrimental to the rest of the competition, you may disallow them from competing.

# After the Competition {.page-break-before}

When the competition is over, **physical records from the competition must be retained by a Delegate of the competition for at least 90 days and digital records for seven years, according to the WCRP.** Paper records tend to be only score sheets and solution sheets for Fewest Moves attempts. Digital records include scrambles, results, financial records, and contracts created through organizing competitions. The Delegate is responsible for compiling the competition results and writing the incidents for the Delegate Report and is encouraged to keep paper records as reference material. The WCA will maintain digital records related to the scrambles and the Delegate Report after the results are uploaded. It is your responsibility as a Delegate to ensure that the organization team has processes in place to maintain digital records related to competition finances for at least seven years. You can do this before the competition when you are ensuring the organization team has a budget and reasonable levels of financial management. Encourage organizers to check requirements for financial record-keeping for the government where the competition was held. The WCA expects financial records to be available for seven years, but your local government requirement could be higher than this, so you should follow that instead.

If your Delegate community has shared equipment, spend time after the competition to coordinate who is taking the equipment home so that they have it ready for the next competition.

## Competition Results

**Ensuring the integrity of all results is one of the main goals of the WCA**. Results are essentially the product of the WCA. Make every reasonable effort to ensure that the results submitted represent what happened at the competition. In particular, always check for the following:

- **Registration data errors**: You need to verify that every issue related to registration data has been resolved (see the Administering Registration Data section). If this has already been done before the competition, as is recommended, no bigger issues are expected at this stage.
- **Score-taking errors**: Always double-check score sheets after they are entered, during or after the competition. You must do the double-checking **before** submitting the results. Reliable organizers or volunteers can help you. When double-checking score sheets, remember to check for missing signatures from the judge or competitor, verify that extra attempts were entered at their correct positions in the average, and check that the ambiguous times are always entered in the worst reasonable interpretation according to [Guideline A7c+](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#A7c+). You should have a different person from the initial score taker perform the double-checking since they might interpret handwriting differently.

Be aware of potential score-taking errors. Score-taking software such as WCA Live will automatically check for results exceeding the time limit or not meeting the cutoff as long as WCA Live is synchronized with the WCA website. However, if you are not using WCA Live and your score-taking software does not automatically check that the results comply with the WCA Regulations, check that every result complies with the stated cutoffs and time limits or cumulative time limits.

- **Cutoffs**: When a competitor does not meet the cutoff for a cutoff round, their subsequent results will be blank, and they will have no average result. Blank results are different from DNF or DNS results. Blank results are interpreted as “no result”.
- **Time limits**: Attempts that exceed the time limits must be changed to DNF.
- **Cumulative time limits**: If a round has a cumulative time limit, ensure that the round format is correct (i.e. not using a cutoff) and that the total of all attempts from the same round (or multiple rounds, if the cumulative limit is shared) does not exceed the limit. If a competitor reaches a cumulative time limit during an attempt, that attempt is recorded as a DNF. Once the competitor has reached a cumulative time limit, the subsequent results are recorded as DNS.

### Double-checking Registration Data

Before submitting results, double-check that the registration data is accurate. Along with the requirements listed in [Administering Registration Data](#administering-registration-data), check the following:

- Every first-time competitor is a real first-time competitor. If you are certain that someone who registered as a first-time competitor has competed before, edit their user account and manually assign their WCA ID before the results submission. If you get an error about mismatching data, double-check with the competitor whether they have competed before, if possible. If they have competed before and the information (e.g. birthdate) on their WCA profile is incorrect, you will need to contact the WRT to correct the mismatching data. If there are any doubts, do not add a WCA ID and mention the issue to the WCA Results Team (WRT) when submitting the results.
- Every first-time competitor represents a country where they hold citizenship and not just their country of residence or heritage.
- The registration data for on-the-spot registrants is accurate, as they are particularly error-prone. Pay special attention to these because otherwise, crucial information such as WCA IDs and/or dates of birth could be unavailable.
- All the data for every competitor with an existing WCA ID matches the data currently stored in the WCA database. If there are any discrepancies and a correction is needed, request this change when submitting the results (see the [Requesting Changes to Personal Data](#requesting-changes-to-personal-data) section).
- If the date of birth for a competitor is still missing after the competition, the WRT will not accept their results. Change it to be blank on the user’s account, and do not enter mock dates such as “1900-01-01”. You must remove these results before submitting and contact the competitor to get their information, after which their results may be recognized.

### Submitting Results

To submit the results for a competition, you must have access to the original folder of the scrambles that were generated using TNoodle. Follow these steps:

1. Modify the events tab with all changes made during the competition, such as adjusting cutoffs or adding rounds.
2. Adjust the number of scramble sets for each round if you generated unused backup scramble sets before the competition or extra scramble sets during the competition. The number of scramble sets must exactly match the number of scramble sets used during each round.
3. Ensure each round in the schedule tab is on its correct day. If needed, modify the schedule tab accordingly.
4. Synchronize your competition results by logging into WCA Live, navigating to your competition, enabling the admin view, clicking the synchronization tab, and clicking the “Synchronize” button.
5. Open [Scrambles Matcher](https://scrambles-matcher.worldcubeassociation.org/) and log in by authorizing it to use your WCA account.
6. Select the competition from the list.
7. Upload the generated scrambles from TNoodle to Scrambles Matcher. Go to the folder where you saved the scramble sets after generating scrambles and select `/Interchange/<competition-name>.json` to upload them. If you generated and used extra sets of scrambles during the competition, upload multiple JSON files.
8. Assign each used scramble set to its respective round by clicking the “Automatically Assign Scrambles” button. Navigate along the left side for each round and drag any scramble sets that were not used during the competition to the “Available” column.
9. When all scramble sets are assigned to rounds, return to the main page and click the “Get Results JSON” button. This downloads a JSON file containing the complete competition results and the scramble data.
10. Submit the results by going to the competition website and navigating to the Upload Results page. Upload the JSON file downloaded from the previous step, then click “Submit”. The website will run a series of checks on the results for common issues and provide a list of errors and warnings.
11. Resolve every error. Read the message next to each error, as it contains useful information about the problem. The errors can often be resolved by going back to one of the previous steps. When every error is resolved, you will need to create and upload a new JSON file from Step 4 onwards and revalidate. **Do not forget to synchronize once again in WCA Live!** Common errors include the following:
    1. Unexpected results for an event. This happens when the results contain an event that was not officially listed for the competition. You must appeal to the WCA Board, who will either add the event or reject the addition.
    2. Missing results for an event. This happens when a competition has an event that no one competed in. You must ask the WRT to remove the event before you re-upload the results.
    3. Unexpected/missing results for a round. You must modify the competition events on the WCA website with an explanation of what happened at the competition.
    4. Unexpected/missing scrambles for a round. Double-check Scrambles Matcher to ensure all used scramble sets are properly assigned to their respective rounds.
    5. Unexpected/missing scrambles for a group. You must modify the events tab to indicate the correct number of scramble sets used in each round.
    6. The number of persons in the competition (###) is above the competitor limit. You must remove the competitors above the limit or appeal to the WRC and request for the limit to be changed retroactively.
    7. Wrong country/name for a person. You must correct the data for the person. If there is a country/name change request, please provide all required information for such cases to the WRT as described below.
    8. Any Regulations-related errors must be rectified.
12. Review the remaining warnings. Read the messages provided and evaluate whether the warning is an actual issue. If it is, fix the issue and upload a new JSON file.
13. **Provide an explanation for each remaining warning**. At this point, the only remaining warnings will be those you have verified as false positives, such as persons with names matching existing WCA IDs. Additionally, provide explanations for anything unusual that happened, such as “competitor chose not to finish average and resulted in DNS”, as the WRT will likely ask about them. Here are some common items that may be listed in the message:
    1. Are there any name changes requested? If so, please list the WCA ID, old name, new name, and which version of the name is included in the submitted JSON file.
    2. Are dates of birth missing, or are you uncertain if a WCA ID is missing?
    3. Have rounds or entire events been dropped during the competition?
    4. Are there records that must be declined due to [Regulation 9i2](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#9i2)?
    5. What was the main event at the competition? This is only necessary if the main event was 3x3x3 Cube. Although the prospective main event is submitted to the WCAT during the competition page submission, this is before the competition occurs. The WRT needs to know **how** a main event was treated as such during the competition.
    6. If there is anything else of importance for the WRT, please do not hesitate to include it. The more detailed it is, the better.
14. Clearly outline anything irregular with the results submission, such as manual edits you made to the JSON file.
15. Click “Submit Results” to send the results to the WRT. Every listed Delegate will receive a confirmation email that the results have been submitted.

### Requesting Changes to Competition Results

If changes need to be made to competition results after they have been submitted, the following information must be provided via “Reply All” in the competition’s **results email thread**:

- Competition name and/or competition ID
- WCA ID and name of the competitor
- Event and round
- Times to be changed
  - Please provide both old and new times for a clear internal historical change record.

Here is an example of a proper change request corresponding to the list above:

- Competition: Example Open 2016 (ID: Example2016)
- Competitor: Jane Doe (2016DOEJ01)
- Pyraminx, First Round
- 3rd attempt: 6.79 -> 6.97
- 5th attempt: 9.32 -> 4.32

Notes:

- If you fail to provide all of the information above, the WRT will likely ask you to resend a complete change request. The WCA ID, which is the unique key to identifying competitors in the WCA database, must never be missing. All results changes must be sent via “Reply All” to the original results thread where you submitted the results JSON.
- If the change stems from a clerical mistake (e.g. a mistake during data entry), just emailing the WRT in the results submission thread is enough. If, however, the change arises from WRC or WIC feedback, the relevant Committee must be included in the CC field.
- For significant changes (e.g. retroactive disqualification of results), Delegates are advised to inform the affected competitors by email or chat before or right after sending the change request to the WRT.

## Delegate Reports

After every competition, the Delegates must submit a Delegate Report. The purpose of the Delegate Report is to prove that the competition was run according to the Regulations and at a sufficient level of quality and to share information that could be relevant to other Delegates. The Delegate Report must be submitted within one week of the end of the competition. If you need an extension on your Delegate Report, inform your Senior Delegate and add the WEAT to the CC field with a notice as soon as possible.

Each of the following sections will describe what to put in each section of the Delegate Report. In general, only interesting or notable items need to be written.

### Venue

It is strongly recommended that you post pictures of the competition setup and venue in your report. These pictures help other Delegates get a sense of what your competition was like and also help the WQAC and WRC verify that the WCA Scramble Accountability Policy was followed. The photos should show the following:

1. General setup overview
2. Scrambling areas
3. Waiting areas, if applicable

Additionally, write down anything else worth mentioning about the venue, such as problems with the lighting or temperature.

### Organization

Write a few sentences about the organization team. You only need a few sentences explaining who the organization team is, whether they did a good job, and whether you would work with them again. Generally, long-winded stories about the organization team are unnecessary.

### Budget

Itemized lists are not required, but you can share them if you wish. At a minimum, explain:

1. Did the competition generate any income aside from registration fees?
2. Did the competition make a profit or lose money?
3. Which entity or person managed the competition finances, and who will be taking the extra attempt money or loss of money? Usually, this is a Regional Organization or sub-Regional Organization.
4. Were any Delegate expenses covered?

### Incidents

Include any notable incidents from the competition. Notable incidents are usually ones that are not included in the [Common Incidents](#common-incidents) table. Not every extra attempt or +2 penalty is an incident worth mentioning in the report. Focus your time on the incidents that could be useful for other Delegates to learn from. Any incidents requiring WRC or WIC feedback must be written here.

Number the incidents in this section so that an incident can be uniquely referenced if there are any questions in the email thread. Include the names of the Delegates who handled each incident, as this helps the WRC make better judgments about Delegate promotions.

If you provided any special accommodations provided under [Regulation 2s](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#2s), you must list them in this section.

### Remarks

The Remarks section is where you can provide any additional information or personal reflections on the competition that you do not feel fit in any of the other sections.

### Responses to Your Report

You might receive responses to your report. If you requested feedback from the WRC or the WIC, expect a response from them. If they do not respond after a couple of weeks, it is best to send them another email in the same thread reminding them about your requested feedback.

Please remember that the Delegate Reports mailing list goes out to hundreds of WCA Volunteers. Consider whether your email needs to include the Delegate Reports mailing list as a recipient. If your email is directed at a small group of individuals, such as a thank you message to a person or Committee, please consider removing unrelated individuals and mailing lists from the email to avoid sending emails irrelevant to the vast majority of WCA Volunteers.

You might not receive responses to your report. This is fine, as some competitions are fairly standard and do not prompt any responses.

## Paying Competition Dues

Most official WCA competitions must pay a small fee as part of the Dues System. While creating a new competition, the website provides an estimate of WCA Dues based on current exchange rates that assumes the competition reaches its competitor limit. However, if you are ever uncertain about how much to expect to pay in Dues while planning a competition, you may use the actual calculation methods described in the [WCA Dues System Policy](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Dues%20System.pdf) yourself or reach out to the WFC for official guidance. Please remember that it is the Delegate’s responsibility to review the competition budget before the competition is announced and to ensure that Dues are being properly accounted for.

The WCA Finance Committee (WFC) will send an invoice within a few days after the WRT uploads the results for the competition. This invoice will arrive via email and will contain a link to a third-party website for collecting payment. Invoices may be issued either to an individual Delegate or to an organization. For many organizations that organize competitions frequently or are responsible for all competition finances in their region, the WFC has set up redirects so that every Dues invoice is sent directly to the organization. If you are delegating in an area that has such an organization, you are probably already familiar with it. Please reach out to the WFC if you are uncertain whether a redirect will apply to your competition’s Dues invoice.

If the invoice is being issued to a Delegate and not redirected to an organization, **only the alphabetically first listed Delegate will receive the invoice**. If you are the Delegate who receives the invoice, it is your duty to inform other competition Delegates about the Dues amount and communicate with the WFC regarding this invoice if needed. Also, you may send the invoice to whoever is completing the payment, such as the organization team, another Delegate, or an association treasurer. If you are forwarding the invoice to someone else for them to pay, it is highly recommended that you request confirmation from them once the payment has been made. There is a payment period of 30 days. There may be repercussions if an invoice is not paid within this timeframe. The Delegate who receives the invoice is responsible for ensuring payment is made on time, even if the actual payment is being made by someone else.

If you ever need an invoice to actually be written out in the name of someone else (not just forwarded to that person for payment), the WFC may manually amend whom the invoice is issued to after you receive it. To do this, please forward the invoice back to the WFC and list the name of the person or organization (which should be shown on the invoice) along with their email and any other info that must be included on the invoice. Once the invoice has been amended, it will be emailed to the new contact.

If you ever have any doubts or questions, you may send an email to [finance@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:finance@worldcubeassociation.org), and they will get back to you as soon as possible.

## Lost and Found

Competitors frequently lose personal items, particularly puzzles, during a competition. If there are unclaimed items at the end of a competition, you or another Delegate can choose what to do with them. You can try to return lost items to their owners, although that is not always feasible or possible. It is appropriate to include a mention of lost items in post-competition communications. Instead of listing the missing items, encourage people to reach out with a description of the item to prevent people from claiming items that don’t belong to them.

# Delegates Outside of the Competition {.page-break-before}

This section covers the responsibilities of a Delegate outside of directly delegating competitions.

## Managing WCA User Accounts

### Accounts vs. Profiles (WCA IDs)

The difference between accounts (i.e. WCA accounts, website accounts, users) and WCA IDs (i.e. profiles, IDs, persons) is a common source of confusion, as they share the following key items of personal data:

|                | Account | WCA ID (Profile) |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| Email address  | Yes     | No               |
| Name           | Yes     | Yes              |
| Date of birth  | Yes     | Yes              |
| Gender         | Yes     | Yes              |
| Country        | Yes     | Yes              |
| Results        | No      | Yes              |

A prospective competitor must create an account before registering for their first competition unless that registration system does not use the WCA website. They provide their own personal data, which is not verified at this stage. It is possible for a person to have multiple website accounts.

A competitor’s personal information is verified at their first competition (see the [Administering Registration Data](#administering-registration-data) section). When results for this competition are posted, a new WCA ID will be created for the competitor, containing the personal data from their account or separately provided registration data for registrations not using the WCA website. Their account will automatically be linked to this WCA ID. A competitor must only have one WCA ID, as this is their unique identifier within the WCA.

A WCA ID is associated with a profile page, which looks like this:

![](images/profile-page.jpg){.centered width=65%}

All competition results in the WCA database are associated with a WCA ID. This page provides access to all results for an individual competitor, along with other interesting results information.

Delegates and WCA Volunteers with access rights may access the account page for a competitor by clicking the pencil icon on a profile page or by using the manage users tool. These individuals, as well as the organizers, may also access the account page via links provided on the registration tab of a competition.

::::: {.page-break-before}
The account page should look like this:

![](images/account-page.jpg){.centered width=60%}
:::::

Personal information may be edited by Delegates and organizers for an account without a WCA ID. Only the WRT may make changes to accounts with WCA IDs (see the [Requesting Changes to Personal Data](#requesting-changes-to-personal-data) section below). Most of the time, Delegates can remove the linked WCA ID from one account and assign it to another account. There are some exceptions that the WRT must handle instead. The personal data fields in both accounts must match for a WCA ID to link to an account.

### Handling WCA ID Claims

Since an account is not inherently attached to a WCA ID, it is possible for a person to have a WCA ID but no account. This usually occurs in one of the following three ways:

- A competitor registered for a competition through on-the-spot registration
- A competition chooses not to use the WCA’s registration system
- A competitor registered for a WCA competition before WCA accounts existed

When such a competitor creates a new account, they are able to claim an existing WCA ID by selecting a WCA ID and a Delegate who can verify the person’s identity. This will send a WCA ID claim email to the selected Delegate. If you receive this email, follow the steps in the email to verify the user’s identity and associate their account with their WCA ID.

If you receive an email and do not believe you are best suited to handle such a request (e.g. if you are unfamiliar with the competitor), forward the email to a Delegate whom you believe would be better able to handle the request. Find an appropriate Delegate by looking at the competition history of the WCA ID and viewing the listed Delegates. If those Delegates are no longer active, forward the email to the appropriate Senior Delegate.

### Requesting Changes to Personal Data

There are several scenarios when change requests concerning personal data (i.e. name, gender, date of birth, and citizenship of a competitor). The WRT has different requirements depending on different circumstances.

There are two types of data changes:

1. **Fix**: A fix changes a person’s data for all past and future competitions such that the person’s old data is not visible on their competitor profile. This form of data change is commonly applied for the following:

- Correction of previously incorrect data
- Any name change in which the competitor does not wish for their previous name to still be displayed anywhere on the WCA website
- Any other changes of a sensitive nature (e.g. changes to gender)

2. **Update**: An update creates a new, internal sub-profile so that the previous data remains unchanged for all past competitions, and a notice of the change is shown on the competitor’s profile. Such a profile would look like this:

![](images/country-change-profile-page.jpg){.centered width=65%}

This form of data change is commonly applied for the following:

- Changes of citizenship
- Non-sensitive name changes where the competitor still wishes to have their previous name displayed for past competitions and as a notice on their profile (e.g. last name changes due to marriage)

**A note on last name changes:** Until July 2024, the WRT executed every non-sensitive last name change as an update. Competitors now have the choice as to whether they would like their name change executed as a fix or as an update. It is possible for any previous name change update to be changed to a fix by contacting the WRT.

Changes in a competitor’s information may be requested directly by the competitor or through a Delegate. If the competitor contacts the WRT directly, a legal document of identification must be provided. If the Delegate is making the request, they must verify the competitor is the correct person and that the information provided is correct (e.g. dates of birth or last names) or sensible (e.g. first name or gender changes).

- Date of birth fixes may be requested by the competitor through the [Birthday Change Request Form](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/contact/dob).
- Name changes: ensure you request the correct type (i.e. fix or update) as described above.
- Changes in gender: the WRT is more lenient with these and only requires proof of identity. Note: As gender changes are mostly sensitive, the WRT executes such changes as fixes, although they are technically updates.
- Send all changes to the WRT with the WCA ID, old data, and new data.

Change requests for a person’s country are particularly delicate, as they affect rankings and possibly records. Therefore, such requests must include the following:

- Documentation of the old nationality (if available)
- Documentation of the new nationality
- A thorough description of the change request, including answers to the following questions:
  - Does the competitor still hold the old nationality (i.e. as a dual nationality)?
  - If not, when did the competitor lose the old nationality? Did the competitor ever hold the old nationality?
  - When did the competitor obtain the new nationality?

**Note**: Residing in a country is **not** equivalent to having citizenship for that country.

Finally, the rules for competitor names described in the [Administering Registration Data](#administering-registration-data) section also apply to name changes.

## Acquiring Competition Equipment

The WCA has negotiated discounted prices for competition equipment from Speed Stacks. The current price list can be found on the gear order form below. Prices do not include taxes and shipping. Within the USA and Canada, shipping fees add approximately $15 to $30 per box. Their largest box fits five display sets. If you live somewhere else, shipping costs could be substantially higher. Your local jurisdiction might also incur customs fees. Contact the WCA Marketing Team if you have questions regarding shipping.

You may place an order using the [WCA Gear Order Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc594bJA55CahKr7F8P-oHK44tn0cZ9NBZst0H5udwKnmh9Og/viewform). A member of the WCA Marketing Team will make the order and guide you through the ordering process. Once the order ships, you will receive an invoice from the WFC, which you may pay via Stripe (i.e. card payment), PayPal, or bank transfer.

### WCA Equipment Funding

At least once a year, the WCA Finance Committee (WFC) performs a round of equipment funding to provide equipment to regions that are unable to easily afford the equipment they need. A few weeks before applications open, the WFC will notify all Delegates via email of the timeframe in which applications will be accepted. The timeframe is typically one entire month. Your application must justify why the WCA should purchase the equipment for you, including the following:

- Listing all the equipment you currently have access to
- Explaining why it would be difficult to purchase equipment on your own
- Demonstrating how having this equipment would allow for growth in your community

Within four weeks of the end of the application period, the WFC will notify applicants how much (if any) of their funding request has been approved. If you are approved for equipment funding, the WFC will immediately work with you to coordinate ordering and shipping it to you. Depending on your financial situation, you might have 100% of the costs covered, or you might need to pay non-equipment costs such as shipping or import taxes. The WFC will clearly state this when explaining their decision on your application so you are aware of what your expected contribution will be.

Any equipment received via WCA Equipment Funding is officially owned by the WCA and held by the recipient as the official custodian of the equipment. If you are a custodian, you are responsible for taking good care of the equipment. You are also responsible for letting the WFC know whether anything happens to it so that they can keep appropriate records of WCA property.

For more information on the WCA Equipment Funding program, please review the [official policy](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Equipment%20Funding.pdf) or reach out to the WFC directly at [finance@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:finance@worldcubeassociation.org).

### WCA Travel Funding

Depending on the region you live in, you might receive requests to delegate in regions that do not yet have their own Delegate. These regions are often less wealthy and might struggle to provide funds for your travel through just the registration fees. The WCA offers the Travel Funding program to support bringing competitions to these new areas.

If you want to use WCA Travel Funding, you must submit [an application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSex2yNko7m6SL12zuMXD6WtowUNzxsNZYXYjx5yvYKYDOPbhQ/viewform) at least 60 days before the competition date while the competition is still unannounced. If the competition is less than 60 days away or is already announced, the application will not be funded. The application must have the official support of a Senior Delegate or Board member as a sponsor, explain how much funding is needed, and explain why the region where the competition will be held cannot provide the funds themselves. The WFC will discuss your application and return a decision to you as quickly as possible so you can move forward with the competition planning process. If your application is approved, the WFC will then work with you to make the necessary purchases (e.g. plane tickets or lodging reservations).

If you are able to use WCA Travel Funding and bring competitions to a new region, please keep an eye out for potential Trainee Delegates or provide support in training existing ones if there are any. Whenever a new region gets its own Junior Delegate, WCA Travel Funding is no longer needed for future competitions there, and other new regions around the world may be the beneficiaries of this program instead. Remember that WCA Travel Funding only applies if the Delegate’s travel is strictly necessary to ensure the competition happens at all. It cannot currently be used to send experienced Delegates to continue the training of Junior Delegates or for Senior/Regional Delegates to visit other areas of their region for supervision.

For more information on the WCA Travel Funding program, please review the [official policy](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Travel%20Reimbursement.pdf) or reach out to the WFC directly at [finance@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:finance@worldcubeassociation.org).

## Engaging in Internal Discussions

As both a Delegate and a WCA Volunteer, you will be receiving emails not directly related to your competitions or your local community, such as other Delegate Reports and requests for feedback on new iterations of the Regulations. You may participate in these discussions as much or as little as you wish. If you choose to engage in these discussions, remember the following:

- Be professional and respectful.
- Other regions have different cultures and ways of running competitions, so what works in one region does not necessarily work everywhere.
- The tone is not always clearly communicated via text.

Be aware that some conversations are simply irrelevant to some individuals. The WCA has hundreds of Volunteers with different responsibilities throughout the organization. When sending an email, review the list of recipients and consider whether each of them needs to receive the email. Consider whether a smaller list of recipients is the intended audience for your message. For discussions with a small number of people, using “Reply All” is often okay. Use stronger discretion when replying to large mailing lists such as [volunteers@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:volunteers@worldcubeassociation.org) or [reports@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:reports@worldcubeassociation.org).

### Replying to Delegate Reports

Reading Delegate Reports of other regions is a great way to expand your knowledge as a Delegate and to gain a better understanding of how competitions might be run in other regions. Feedback from Delegates is especially helpful whenever WRC or WIC feedback is requested, as the incidents that require feedback are often the least straightforward ones and have the most to learn from.

If you have questions related to the competition, you may ask the Delegates by responding to their email. However, do be aware that your response will be sent to hundreds of WCA Volunteers, so consider whether it is appropriate to remove the Delegate Reports mailing list from the CC field to avoid sending an email to many people who might not appreciate it showing up in their inbox again.

Furthermore, it is not a Delegate’s responsibility to review other Delegates’ competition reports for Regulation or quality violations. If you have a concern regarding the way something was handled at a competition based on the report, privately contact the relevant WCA Committee and/or the Senior Delegate for the competition’s region to handle the concern on your behalf.

If you are a Full Delegate, you may opt out of receiving Delegate Reports by navigating to your WCA profile, clicking on the “edit” button, and unchecking the box “I would like to receive Delegate Reports of WCA Competitions by email”. While this box can be unchecked for Junior and Trainee Delegates, you will still receive reports until you are promoted to Full Delegate.

Since a lot of Delegate Reports are sent out every week, you might find it useful to set up email filters for them. Instructions for setting up email filters for your email account can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18qKgleupdm52CHSodYBIMdxF4ny_pqvkaqsPIfL5ulM/edit?usp=sharing). The link is only accessible to users with a WCA email address.

### Disputes and Appeals

Some decisions made by WCA Volunteers might be controversial. Any person affected by a decision (e.g. the Delegate of a competition where an incident occurred or the competitor whose results are disputed) may file a dispute in accordance with the [Disputes Motion](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/motions/16.2024.1%20-%20Disputes.pdf). The Committee responsible for reviewing the dispute will provide a decision within 60 days. As a Delegate, you are responsible for ensuring that the decision of the Team or Committee handling the dispute is carried out immediately. Usually, this requires you to send an email to the WRT with the requested result changes.

Further disagreements with the result of a dispute could be escalated to an appeal. Even if an appeal was filed, you must still carry out the original decision of the dispute until the result of the appeal is provided.

## Recommending a Delegate

While you are delegating, you can look for Community members who could be trained to become a Delegate. Having more Delegates could alleviate the workload of existing Delegates and could provide more options to better serve the needs of a remote cubing community. There are no precise rules about how many Delegates are required for a specific region or where Delegates should be located. Discuss with any other local, Regional, or Senior Delegate whether adding a new Delegate is an appropriate step for your community.

To start the process of inducting a Community member as a Delegate, take the following steps:

1. Recommend the person to your Senior and Regional Delegate with a reason for why this person should be a Delegate and why the region the person is located in needs a Delegate.
2. If the Senior Delegate agrees, they will fill out the application form to make the person a Trainee Delegate and submit it to the Board.
3. If the Board agrees, the Senior Delegate will have the new Trainee Delegate agree to and sign the [Code of Conduct](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf) and [Code of Ethics](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf) and disclose any potential conflicts of interest.
4. The Senior Delegate will then update the new Trainee Delegate’s status on the WCA website.
5. The Trainee Delegate must then send a short introduction email to the Board. They may choose to also send it to their Regional Delegate mailing list.

After the above steps are completed, the person will be officially appointed as a new Trainee Delegate.

## Supporting Your Local Community

One of your responsibilities as a Delegate is to foster the health of your local cubing community. This provides a way for you to communicate with your community outside of competitions and also for your community to engage with each other. Popular ways to do this include the following:

- Social media groups or pages
- Websites
- Mailing lists

On the websites of your competitions, you may create a “Community” tab that links to these additional resources.

If you do create an online community, you are responsible for effectively moderating the space. Create rules that align with the WCA’s Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics, and strive to make the community a welcoming place for everyone. Additionally, consider the terms of service of the platform you use.

### Business Cards

Delegates are the face of the WCA and are the Volunteers with whom most members of the public will interact. Delegates often need to introduce themselves to new people both inside and outside of a competition, so it can be useful to have business cards. The WCA has a business card template that Delegates can use to print their own business cards. It includes a QR code that links to a LinkTree page with various WCA resources.

The templates are designed for use with VistaPrint, which is available in the USA, Canada, and many countries in Europe. If you are in a country where VistaPrint is unavailable, you can use the template to create your own business cards with a local printing service.

The following are steps to create a business card using VistaPrint. Screenshots of each step are available [here](https://imgur.com/a/i28RZmo).

1. Download the business card assets from the [WMT Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QG4Zg5vGTzxzwMxEkLmFvtM0iV_KhIC1). _Note: Only Volunteers with a WCA email address can access this link._
2. Go to the [VistaPrint website](https://www.vistaprint.com/business-cards).
3. Go to “Upload Design”, choose “Standard Horizontal” for style, and upload `wcaCardBackground.png`.
4. Click “Make more edits” on the bottom.
5. Using the font Catamaran and the reference images as a guide, position four text boxes with the following text:

::::: {.indent}
World Cube Association (Size 8, Bolded)

[Delegate Name] (Size 11, Bolded)

Junior/Full Delegate (Size 8, Not Bolded)

[Delegate’s WCA Email] (Size 8, Not Bolded)
:::::

If the font Catamaran does not support your language, you can use a different font as long as it is sans-serif and legible. Contact the WCA Marketing Team at [marketing@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:marketing@worldcubeassociation.org) if you need assistance choosing an appropriate font.

6. Add `wcaLogo.png` as an image and position it using the reference image as a guide.
7. Optionally add local/regional information on the back.
8. Once purchased, this cost can be reimbursed using competition funds.

## Contributing to the Delegate Handbook

The _Delegate Handbook_ is an ever-evolving resource and is subject to change as the WCA and the cubing community change. every WCA Volunteer is encouraged to contribute. If you want to fix, improve, or otherwise change the document, it can be found in the [WCA Documents GitHub repository](https://github.com/thewca/wca-documents). If you already know how to use Git and GitHub, the best way to contribute is by opening a Pull Request or an Issue. Otherwise, send a message to the WCA Quality Assurance Committee at [quality@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:quality@worldcubeassociation.org) and describe the changes you would like to propose.

Due to the length and complexity of this document and the need to update it semi-regularly, there is currently no option to create official translations of the Delegate Handbook. Since the language used for communication within the WCA is American English, it is expected that most Delegates can read this document.
