# WCA Volunteer Crash Course

Hello and welcome to the wonderful community of Volunteers who help run the World Cube Association! We are happy to have you among us!

Most of the important rules and common practices you need to know will be described in this document to help you get started. However, the single most important advice is to **ask your Leader and/or Committee/Team when you are uncertain.** They will be happy to help you out!

## Important Documents

WCA Volunteers should be familiar with every document related to their work as WCA Volunteers. All relevant documents are on [the documents page](wca{documents}) and on [the Volunteer panel](wca{panel}). The Volunteer panel section is available only to WCA Volunteers and contains Volunteer-exclusive knowledge. Therefore, every document on that page should be read. The documents section contains information on how the WCA functions and is available to the public. Not every document in this section needs to be memorized. However, here are the ones that are absolutely necessary to know well:

- [The Code of Ethics](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf}) describes how every WCA Volunteer must act and what they must abide by.
- [The Spirit of the WCA](wcadoc{documents/motions/01.2021.1%20-%20Spirit.pdf}).
- If you are a member of a Committee/Team, [The Committees and Teams Motion](wcadoc{documents/motions/10.2022.0%20-%20Committees%20and%20Teams.pdf}) will explain how Committees/Teams operate. Additionally, you will find the relevant motion for your Committee/Team among the other listed motions on the documents page.
- If you are a Delegate, [The Delegates Motion](wcadoc{documents/motions/08.2022.1%20-%20Delegates.pdf}) will explain how your work as a Delegate will be conducted. You should also familiarize yourself with the [Delegate Handbook](wcadoc{edudoc/delegate-handbook/delegate-handbook.pdf}).

## Email

The primary form of communication for the WCA is emails. All channels are managed by a platform called Google Groups. You should have been added to all relevant groups already, as these are automatically handled when you are officially added to the Committee/Team on the WCA website.

**When you respond to an email, use the “Reply All” option.** This is to ensure that all relevant people on the thread are still getting the reply.

Whichever mail interface you are using, go and find the “Reply All” button. It also helps to keep the Google Group for the Committee/Team in a Carbon Copy (CC). Some interfaces (e.g. Gmail) also allow setting “Reply All” as the default reply option, which can be useful.

When there are important matters within a region or regarding a specific Delegate, you add the Senior Delegate to the CC field.

Please remember that the expected response time for WCA is 48 hours. If you are having trouble meeting this response time, please inform the recipient that you are expecting to give a delayed reply.

Additionally, if you have not received a reply in a timely manner, you should follow up with the corresponding party. While it is the corresponding party’s responsibility to take the appropriate action, sometimes you will need to gently remind them to do so.

More broadly speaking, the preferred approach in the WCA is “over-communication”, which keeps every relevant person in the loop at all times. If you think there is a topic that other Volunteers should see, please add them to the CC field. For example, if you escalate an issue about a specific Delegate to any Committee/Team, ensure you add their Senior and/or Regional Delegate to the CC field.

## Making Changes to Recipients {.page-break-before}

When you make changes to the recipients, make this clear at the top of the email. If there is a need to include another Committee/Team in the thread, then begin by writing a “+” along with the name of the Committee/Team so everyone is aware. When removing someone from a thread, write a “-” followed by their name. For example:

::::: {.indent}
Hello **recipient name**,

(+WQAC -WRC)

**Your email text would go here**
:::::

If a change is needed and the original recipient needs to know it has gone through and has been taken care of, they can be moved to the BCC field, allowing them to see the last email go through. After that, they will not receive further emails on the thread.

Lastly, for Committee/Team internal discussions, you can take a shortcut by removing everyone except your Committee/Team’s email address and writing, “*[Committee/Team] Only*”.

## Representation

Every WCA Volunteer will also have received login credentials for their own personal *@worldcubeassociation.org* email account hosted by GSuite.

This account must always be used when sending WCA-related emails. The only times exceptions may be made are when the Volunteer has issues with the GSuite Software in the region where they live.

Configure your new GSuite account to include a signature that includes your name and your position. Do not include anything else, such as personal bests or YouTube channels! Be aware that this signature will be visible to **every recipient, along with a legal disclaimer for recipients outside of the** *@worldcubeassociation.org* domain.

Think twice before sending a private message through this account. You should never use this email for any work that is unrelated to the WCA. Please refer to the [WCA Email Account Policy](wcadoc{documents/policies/internal/Email%20Account.pdf}) for details.

## Mailing Lists

There are several mailing lists, all of which have their dedicated audience and purposes. Every Team and Committee’s email addresses can be found on the [contact page of the WCA](wca{contact}), along with a brief description of their scope of work.

Other significant mailing lists include the following:

- [reports@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:reports@worldcubeassociation.org) - Recipient channel for all Delegate Reports worldwide. You can opt in on your WCA profile settings page.
- [volunteers@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:volunteers@worldcubeassociation.org) - This is the channel where communication relevant to the entire organization takes place. Only the really heavy topics and global discussions belong here.
- [announcements@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:announcements@worldcubeassociation.org) - This channel is only used for one-off important announcements and for changes approved by the Board. This channel will never be the main recipient. It is only ever a recipient in the Blind Carbon Copy (BCC) field. As previously mentioned, every discussion will be made on [volunteers@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:volunteers@worldcubeassociation.org)
- [Delegates@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:Delegates@worldcubeassociation.org) -  Communication for all Delegates. This is used only if the expected target to reach is only Delegates. Every Delegate must read these discussions. However,[volunteers@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:volunteers@worldcubeassociation.org) is more commonly used for discussions.

**Treat any communication sent through these lists as confidential**! All contents are generally limited to the target audience defined by the recipient list, except for official announcements by Teams and Committees.

## Delegate Reports

Every WCA Volunteer may opt-in to receive Delegate Reports. To do this, the Volunteer goes to the “[Edit Profile](wca{profile/edit})” page and scrolls to the bottom, where they can check off the box labeled “I would like to receive Delegate Reports of WCA Competitions by email”. Every Volunteer with valuable input is welcome to join in on discussions for Delegate Reports, even if they are not Delegates.

## Public Appearance

Every WCA Volunteer is associated with their Committee/Team on the WCA website. Therefore, you will need to demonstrate professionalism if someone were to navigate to your WCA Page. Consequently, please ensure you upload a nice picture of yourself as your avatar. You can upload an avatar and see all the guidelines that apply to WCA Volunteers [here](wca{profile/edit?section=avatar}).

Volunteers should also consider how they appear on online cubing forums (e.g. WCA Forum and Speedsolving Forum). Volunteers should also be careful when speaking about internal matters to ensure no confidential information is leaked.

## Filters and Spam Folders

Every WCA Volunteer should create a filter to permit all mail sent from an *@worldcubeassociation.org* mailing address so they do not miss any important information. This can be done by navigating to [https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters) and scrolling to the bottom where it says “Create a new filter”. There you set the “from” to “worldcubeassociation.org” and click “create filter”. Finally, set it to “Never mark as spam”.

Please remember that it is possible for someone to forge an email as if it were sent from a WCA email account despite not having access to that account. These kinds of emails are usually detected by Gmail spam filters thanks to the SPF/DKIM signatures on the email. Remember that the suggested filter bypasses this check, so you should check the signature when receiving a suspicious email.

## Communicating Dates and Times

Whenever you are trying to arrange a meeting or set a deadline that requires agreement on an exact point in time, remember to send your suggestion in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Your morning time might be the middle of the night for someone else on your Committee/Team. UTC helps eliminate a lot of misunderstandings.

## Chrome Profiles

If you have multiple Google accounts in use (e.g. one for personal use and your WCA email), one way to keep things organized is through Chrome Profiles. It allows you to keep all your accounts separate, including bookmarks, passwords, and history. Using Chrome Profiles will prevent you from needing to log in to Google Drive, even if you have already switched accounts. To set up your Chrome Profiles, view the steps [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en). Lucas Garron has created a dedicated [color profile](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-chrome-theme/ijbkjldjcdhecihbhmofmencofglhhbp) that you can use to tell your profiles apart.

## Committee/Team-Specific Communication

There might be additional resources and/or rules for your specific Committee/Team. Just as mentioned in the beginning, do reach out to your leader. They will tell you the appropriate procedures for your Committee/Team.

Thank you for your contributions. Enjoy the journey!
