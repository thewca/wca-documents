# WCA Staff Crash Course

Hello and welcome to the wonderful community of volunteers that help run the World Cube Association! We’re happy to have you among us. :)

To facilitate communication and reduce overhead as much as possible, there are a few important rules and common practices that you need to know.\
Most of the important things will be described in this document to help you get started. However, the single-most important advice is: **Ask your Leader and/or team if you’re unsure!**\
They will be glad to help you out.

## Important Documents

WCA Staff should be familiar with all the documents related to their work as WCA Staff. All relevant documents can be found on [the documents page](wca{documents}) and on [the Staff panel](wca{panel}). The Staff panel section is available only to WCA Staff and contains Staff exclusive knowledge. Therefore, all documents on that page should be read. The documents section contains various knowledge regarding how the WCA functions and is available to the public. Not all documents in this section are necessary to know by heart, however here are the ones that are absolutely necessary to know well:

  - [The Code of Ethics](wcadoc{documents/Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf}); This describes how all WCA Staff must act and what they must abide by.
  - [The Spirit of the WCA](wcadoc{documents/motions/01.2021.1%20-%20Spirit.pdf}).
  - If you are a member of a committee or team; [The Committees and Teams Motion](wcadoc{documents/motions/10.2022.0%20-%20Committees%20and%20Teams.pdf}). This will explain how committees and teams operate. Additionally, you will find the relevant motion for your committee or team amongst the other listed motions on the documents page.
  - If you are a Delegate; [The Delegates Motion](wcadoc{documents/motions/08.2022.1%20-%20Delegates.pdf}). This will explain how your work as a Delegate will be conducted. There is also a specific Crash Course for Delegates that you should familiarize yourself with.

## Email

The primary form of communication for the WCA is emails. All channels are managed by a platform called Google Groups; you should have been added to all relevant groups already as these are handled automatically when you are officially added to the team on the WCA website.\
**When you respond to an email, use the “Reply All” option.** This is to ensure that all relevant people on the thread are still getting the reply.\
Whatever mail interface you’re using, go and find the “Reply All” button. It will become your best friend. In particular, it helps to keep the team’s GGroup in a Carbon Copy (CC). Some interfaces (e.g. GMail) also allow setting “Reply All” as default reply option, which can be very helpful.

When there are important matters within a region, or regarding a specific Delegate, you should CC the Senior Delegate.

Please remember that the expected response time for WCA is 48 hours. If you are having trouble meeting this response time, please inform the recipient that you are expecting to give a delayed reply.\
Additionally, if you have not received a reply in a timely manner, you should ping the corresponding party. While it is the responsibility of the corresponding party to take the appropriate action, sometimes you will need to gently remind them to do so.

More broadly speaking, the preferred  approach is “over-communication” in the WCA by keeping all relevant persons in the loop at all times. If you think there is a topic which other staff members should see, please add them to as a Carbon Copy (CC) to the email. For example, if you escalate an issue about a specific Delegate to any Team/Committee, be sure to include their Senior and/or Regional Delegate in CC.

## Making changes to recipients {.page-break-before}

When you make changes to the recipients, make this clear at the top of the email. If there is a need to include another team/committee to the thread then begin by writing a “+” along with the name of the team/committee so everyone is aware. When removing someone from a thread they were once a part of you write a “-” followed by their name. For Example:

::::: {.indent}
Hello **recipient name**,

(+WQAC -WRC)

**Your email text would go here**
:::::

If a change is needed and the original recipient needs to see it has gone through and has been taken care of, they can be moved to BCC, allowing them to see the last email go through. After that, they will not receive further emails on the thread.

Lastly, for team/committee internal discussion you can take a shortcut by removing everyone but your team/committee’s email address and write “*[TEAM] Only*”.

## Representation

Every WCA Staff member will also have received login credentials for their own personal *@worldcubeassociation.org* email account hosted by GSuite.\
This account must always be used when sending WCA-related emails. Exceptions may be made only if the Staff Member has issues with the GSuite Software in the region where they live.

Configure your new GSuite account to include a signature that comprises your name and your position (and nothing else, like 3x3 PBs or YouTube channels!). Be aware that this signature will be visible to **any recipient, along with a legal disclaimer for recipients outside of the** *@worldcubeassociation.org* domain.

Think twice before sending any form of private messages through this account. You should never use this email for any work that is not related to the WCA. Please refer to the [WCA Email Account Policy](wcadoc{documents/policies/internal/Email%20Account.pdf}) for details.

## Mailing Lists

There are several mailing lists which all have their dedicated audience and purposes. All team and committee addresses can be found on the [contact page of the WCA](wca{contact}), along with a brief description of their scope of work.\
Other significant mailing lists include:

  - [reports@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:reports@worldcubeassociation.org) - Recipient channel for all Delegate reports, worldwide. You can opt-in on your WCA profile settings page.
  - [staff@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:staff@worldcubeassociation.org) - This is the channel where communication related to the entire organization takes place. Only the really heavy stuff like global discussions belong here.
  - [announcements@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:announcements@worldcubeassociation.org) - This channel is only used for one-off announcements which are very important and for changes approved by the Board. This channel will never be the main recipient, and is only ever to be referred to in BCC. As previously mentioned, all discussions will be made on [staff@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:staff@worldcubeassociation.org)
  - [delegates@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:delegates@worldcubeassociation.org) - Communication for all Delegates. This is used only if the expected target to reach is only Delegates. It is mandatory for all Delegates to read these discussions! Usually [staff@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:staff@worldcubeassociation.org) will be better used for discussions.

In general, consider that any communication sent through these lists may be confidential! All contents are generally limited to the target audience defined by the recipient list, except for official announcements by the Committees/Teams.

## Delegate Reports

Every WCA Staff member can opt-in to receive Delegate Reports. To do this, the Staff member goes to the "[Edit Profile](wca{profile/edit})" page, and scrolls to the bottom where they can check off the box labeled “I would like to receive Delegate Reports of WCA Competitions by email.” Every Staff member with valuable input is welcome to join in on discussions for Delegate Reports, even if they are not Delegates.

## Public Appearance
Every Staff member is associated with their team on the WCA website. You will therefore have to exhibit a certain kind of professionalism if someone were to navigate to your WCA Page. Consequently, please make sure to upload a nice picture of yourself as your avatar. You can upload an avatar [here](wca{profile/edit?section=avatar}), as well as seeing all the guidelines which apply to WCA Staff.

Staff members should also consider how they appear on online forums in regards to WCA and cubing in general. As well, Staff members should be careful when speaking about internal matters to make sure no confidential information is leaked.

## Filters and spam folders

All WCA Staff should create a filter which will whitelist all mails sent from an *@worldcubeassociation.org* mailing address so they don’t miss any important information. This can be done by navigating to [https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters) and scrolling to the bottom where it says “Create a new filter”. There you set the “from” to “worldcubeassociation.org” and click “create filter”. Finally, set it to “Never mark as spam”.

Please note, it is possible for basically anyone to forge a mail as if it were sent from a WCA email account despite not having access to that account. This kind of emails are usually detected by gmail spam filters thanks to the SPF/DKIM signatures on the email. The suggested whitelist filter bypasses this check, so you should make sure to keep this in mind when receiving suspicious emails and check these signatures.

## Communicating Dates and Times

Whenever trying to arrange a meeting or set a deadline that requires agreement on an exact point in time, remember to send your suggestion in UTC. What is breakfast time for you may be the middle of the night for someone else on your team. UTC helps eliminate a lot of misunderstandings.i

## Chrome Profiles

If you have multiple Google accounts in use (e.g. one for personal use and your WCA email), one way to keep things organized is through Chrome Profiles. It allows you to keep all your accounts separate, including bookmarks, passwords, and history. Using Chrome Profiles will avoid having to re-login on Google Drive even if you’ve already switched accounts, for instance. To set up your Chrome Profiles, you can view the steps [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en). Lucas Garron has created a dedicated [color profile](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-chrome-theme/ijbkjldjcdhecihbhmofmencofglhhbp) that you can use to tell your profiles apart.

## Team Specific Communication

There may be additional resources and/or rules for your specific committee. Just as mentioned in the beginning, do reach out to your leader! They will tell you the appropriate procedures for your team/committee.

Thank you for your contributions and enjoy the journey!
