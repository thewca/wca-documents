# WCA Delegate Crash Course

"_Given the many times we see ourselves in the need to explain the things in this document to new Delegates, I have found some time to draft it so that some time may be saved. Still, I believe it is the responsibility of the recommending Delegate and/or the Senior Delegate to instruct [Trainee] Delegates in these matters. Feel free to use a link to this document to save yourselves some time._" - Natán Riggenbach, former WCA Board member, January 2014

This document is supposed to provide a lot of important information for your job as a WCA Delegate. The Delegate Crash Course was initially started as a Google Document by Natán Riggenbach in January 2014 and has since grown and evolved with the addition and contribution of the WCA Board, the WCA Committees and Teams, and the WCA Senior Delegates.

## On the Trainee Delegateship

_(updated on September 9, 2023)_

A Delegate starts off as a Trainee Delegate and keeps that status until, after overseeing/running some competitions, it is considered by the Regional or Senior Delegate that Junior status is warranted. The traineeship serves as a testing period that should confirm that the appointment was indeed appropriate for both the Trainee Delegate and the WCA.

Although a Trainee Delegate has the same responsibilities as a Junior or Full Delegate at a competition, there are some restrictions to the Trainee Delegate status:

- Trainee Delegates cannot post delegate reports or submit results, but are still allowed to write reports and compile results for another Delegate to submit
- Trainee Delegates cannot delegate a competition without the supervision of a Junior or Full Delegate, except under emergency circumstances which must be approved by the WCA Board
- Trainee Delegates do not have a WCA email address, nor access to internal resources such as the WCA Google Drive
- Trainee Delegates do not have access to the Poll area of the WCA website

### The roles of a WCA Delegate include, but not limited to:

- Keeping up to date on this Delegate crash course
- Being responsible for your community and for closer areas as well, where support is needed
- Delegating official WCA Competitions
- Submitting the competition report, results, and scrambles within a week of the competition
- Being an active member on the WCA Staff and Delegate mailing lists: pay attention to the conversations, feel free to join one if you have something valuable to add and also feel free to start one if you think it is appropriate. There will be a lot of emails, but the info there will be useful.

### General Advice

- When communicating via email, Reply-All should be used at all times except when sensitive issues require leaving someone out of the conversation.
- The interested party should follow up on requests and inquiries if a response is not received within 48 hours. The Board has many things to attend to and sometimes messages slip by and go without a response. It is the responsibility of the Delegate to follow things through to completion.
- When reporting incidents and important issues to the Board, the senior Delegate should be cc’ed.
- A reasonable response rate is generally expected from Delegates. A reasonable response rate is usually within 48 hours and at most within a week, unless special circumstances arise.
- The information exchanged over the Delegates' mailing list is confidential. These are conversations among Delegates and there is no reason for them to leave the list except as part of official announcements by the Board or the Committees/Teams.

## On accepting to delegate a competition

_(added on Sep. 20, 2016)_

- The Delegate must make sure that the organization team is able to hold the competition with all the guarantees
  - A suitable venue is correctly booked
    - with enough room to hold the competition
    - with the appropriate lighting
    - with correct climatization if needed
    - with the necessary supplies and facilities (power sockets, tables, chairs, nearby places to eat and for accommodation...)
  - The organization team is aware of all their duties:
    - providing scramblers, judges and runners for all the rounds
    - assigning a trusted person in charge of any side venue if necessary (under demand and acceptance by the Delegate)
    - score-taking the results, publishing the results of finished rounds and providing score-cards
    - keeping up to date the official website of the competition and making it informative enough
    - being in charge of making comply the venue rules
  - The Delegate must coordinate with other Delegates
    - The Delegate must inform the rest of Delegates in his/her country about his/her plans on known upcoming competitions
    - In case of delegating in another country, the Delegate must make sure that
      - local Delegates are aware and
        - none of them is available to Delegate or
        - they are OK with a foreign delegation

## Requesting a competition

_(updated on September 11, 2023)_

To request an official competition you first need to create a new competition by going to the “[New Competition](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/new)” page. This provides a form with all the necessary information to submit a competition. To speed up this process, you have the option to clone an existing competition; this is useful for you, in case a lot of the information from that competition is reusable. Cloning can be done by going to the page of the desired competition and pressing the “Clone” button on the left sidebar.

### Some general rules about requesting a competition:

- The competition must be announced **at least 28 days** before the scheduled start of the competition. You should **submit the competition earlier than this** as a safety measure so that if there is an issue with the competition, then the competition will likely still be announced before the 28-day deadline.
- The competition must comply with the [Competition Requirements Policy](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Competition%20Requirements.pdf). This means your competition should be at least 10 kilometers and 5 days away from all other competitions. There can be exceptions made to the Proximity Policy if the Delegate has valid arguments. Examples can be found in the policy.

### How to fill out the new competition page:

- The name of the competition must follow the [Competition Requirements Policy](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Competition%20Requirements.pdf). Even if you are choosing a name which is obvious for you why it complies with the policy, you must still give an explanation of the name in the “The reason for the name” field.
  - The competition nickname should be the same as the actual name of the competition if it is 32 or fewer characters with few exceptions. If the name of the competition is over 32 characters, you should pick a nickname which is as close as possible to the actual name. The nickname is only used for display purposes and is what will be shown on the “[Competitions](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions)” page and in the “[Rankings](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php)” page.
  - The ID should be the same as the name or nickname with few exceptions.
- When writing the location of the venue, please be sure to write with the correct formatting. The country should not be written in the “City name” field. If you are from a country with subregions/states like the United States, you must write the city name first, and then the state in full. For example, this would look like “Portland, Oregon”, Note: NOT “Portland, OR”.
- The coordinates of the competition must be set correctly. You should zoom in on the pointer, and make sure it is pointing where the venue is, and not in a crossroad.
- The competitor limit of the competition must be listed and must be suitable for the community. The WCAT will use past competitions in the area to determine if this competitor limit is acceptable or not. In general, competitions should have a limit of over 50 competitors. Exceptions will rarely be made, so please be sure to find a venue which is acceptable for the community.
- The relevant information must be filled out such that the automated registrations requirements reflect the rules for signing up to the competition. This includes The competitor limit, registration fee, fee for spectators, a refund policy, and information on whether or not you are accepting on-site registrations.
  - The box for extra registration requirements must only be used to explain something regarding the registration requirements or be something important regarding the registration process which is not otherwise reflected. This is the place to include details for a money transfer, and not a separate tab. It is also okay to state that payment details will be sent to the competitor once they register. This can include where the potential payment will take place, if Stripe is not being used. This can also include that a foreign competitor may contact the organization team to be accepted in case they are not able to make a bank transfer.
- If you are not from the country/state where the competition will take place, please make sure that the local Delegates are informed of the competition before confirming and are okay with you delegating it.
- If your competition is not on a weekend, please confirm it in the “remarks” section.

### Adding events and a schedule:

The usage of the schedule and events tab is mandatory for every WCA Competition.

- The “Manage Events” page is under the “Edit” section on the left sidebar. You must fill out the number of rounds for each event and the round formats, cutoffs, time limits, and advancement conditions for each round. **Don’t forget to press save!** This will create an “Events” tab on the competition website, which will be visible to everyone. This is used as an overview for competitors.
- Once the events page is set up, you can create the schedule. The “Manage Schedule” page under the “Edit” section. There you will find all of the events and rounds which you filled out on the “Manage Events” page. When you have filled the schedule out with all the rounds in their respective allocated time slots, press save; this will create a new “Schedule” tab on the competition website. All the information in the “Events” tab will also be found there.

After you have followed all the steps and double-checked that everything is correct, you scroll to the bottom of the competition form and press “Confirm”. This action will create an email notification to all Delegates of the competition, your Senior Delegate, and WCAT. This email is used for the WCAT to know your competition is ready to be reviewed. It may take up to 48 hours before you receive a reply. This email thread will then be the official announcement thread of the competition in case you need to make any changes. You should not add anyone to this thread unless you have a very good reason for it! You are not allowed to add the organizers to this thread, with no exception!

### Requesting a Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competition

A Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competition is a competition taking place in different venues at the same time. At such a competition ONLY 3x3x3 Fewest Moves is held and all competitors get the same scrambles. These competitions are made to make it easier for competitors to compete in a less popular event which is not very regularly held.

There are differences in the [Competition Requirements Policy](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Competition%20Requirements.pdf) which apply to Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competitions. These competitions can be held as long as:

- None of the locations are closer than 10 kilometers to a regular competition.
- There can be made exceptions if both competitions are least 5 days apart, or the other competition must not have 3x3x3 Fewest Moves as an event.

Keep these points in mind when requesting a Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competition. The points listed either supersede the listed point for regular competitions or are additions to the regular competition form.

- The coordinates of the competition should be either one of the listed venues or be set to a location which has a special meaning to the region where the Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competition is taking place.
- The name should include Fewest Moves or FMC in the name of the competition to further stress that it is a Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competition.
- There must be a place on the competition website (on the WCA website that could be a tab) where it is clearly stated all of the address for the different locations and who will be the official Delegate of that venue. It should further be written under that tab if there is a specific entry fee and competitor limit for that venue. It must be written in the extra registration requirements if there a different competitor limits for the different venues.
- All Delegates of the different venues must be listed as an official Delegate of the competition.
- The latest deadline to add a new location is 28 days before the competition.
- An address can be listed as “To be decided” until 14 days before the start of the competition.
- There should not be a competitor limit of the entire competition. However, each individual location should have its own competitor limit.
- The city must be listed as “Multiple cities”.
- If there are different time zones for the different venues, it should be made clear in the schedule which times the competitors will be competing in the different venues. The time zones must be adjusted so that all competitors will be doing their attempts simultaneously.

### Making changes to an existing competition

All request for changes to an existing competition must be made using “Reply All” on the same email thread which was created when you submitted the competition and used to announce it.

- To request changes to the competition's official Delegates:
  - To add a Delegate, mention the name of the Delegate and ask for them to be added, and WCAT will add the Delegate.
  - To remove a Delegate, the same process applies; mention the name of the Delegate and ask for them to be removed, and WCAT will remove the Delegate.
- To request changes of listed organizers:
  - This request must include their name and should also include their WCA ID if they have one. They must have an account to be listed!
- To change the existing events of the competition:
  - Addition of events: At least 7 days prior to the competition, ask for adding the event as an official event of the competition. In the request, explain why you would like the event added, and attach a new schedule with the event included. The WCAT will then review your request, and if the request is approved, the WCAT will add the event(s) to the list of official events of the competition. After that is done, you have to write a mail to WCAT and all competitors in BCC informing them of this change and offer to have the event included in their registration. Once approved, make sure to have the updated schedule on the competition website.
  - Removal of events: Ask for the removal of the event from the list of official events of the competition. In the request, explain the reason for the removal of the event. After approval, you will have to update the competition schedule on the website. After this is done, you have to write a mail to all competitors and WCAT in BCC, to make them aware of the change.
- Closing/extending the registration period:
  - If you need to **close registration earlier than expected**, explain why you are requesting to have the registration period closed now. A valid reason could include that the competitor limit has now been reached and the waiting list is filled to the extent where people registering now do not have any chance of making it to the competitor list.
  - **Extending the registration period:** Write an email on the competition thread and ask for an extension. The email must include closing time **in UTC** and date. You must also write the reasons for the extension. A valid reason could be that you have fewer registrations than expected.
  - Re-opening the registration would mean a **second registration period**. This must be announced at least 48 hours before it is scheduled to start. The request must be written to WCAT with times and dates **in UTC**. A valid reason could be that you have fewer registrations than expected. This approach can also be used for proposing on-site-registration (OTS).
- Requesting an increase in competitor limit: Delegates can request a change to the limit of a competition by providing a valid reason. Potential reasons for increasing the competitor limit are that you have a larger venue than initially expected or the competitor to guest ratio is lower than expected. Registrations must **never** be accepted before WCAT approves the limit increase.

## Administering competition results

_(updated on December 22, 2022)_

### Preparation and score taking tools

The WCA highly recommends using [WCA Live](https://live.worldcubeassociation.org/) for recording competition results. WCA Live is a platform for running WCA competitions and sharing live results with the world. Below, we combine important parts of Jonatan Kłosko’s [Guide](https://github.com/thewca/wca-live/wiki/Guide) with additional important advice:

- To set up your competition, just [sign in](https://live.worldcubeassociation.org/admin) to the admin section and select the competition that you want to set up.
- Events, competitors, and schedule are loaded from the WCA website into WCA Live. If you make any changes to these, you must synchronize them by clicking the synchronize button on the admin page.
- The recommended way for generating scorecards is [Groupifier](https://groupifier.jonatanklosko.com/). Synchronizing (as above) is needed before generating scorecards for subsequent rounds.
- If your competition allows on-the-spot (OTS) registrations, registrations can be added at [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/YOUR-COMPETITION-ID/registrations/add](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/YOUR-COMPETITION-ID/registrations/add) (where you replace YOUR-COMPETITION-ID with the ID of your competition).

**Important**: For the unlikely case of WCA Live being temporarily unavailable, it is highly recommended to have a copy of the [standard results workbook template](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/files/results.xls) available as an emergency fallback.

### Administering registration data

Special care must be taken when handling the registration data. As problems with registration data can often be easily clarified when talking to the affected competitor during the competition, but are significantly harder to solve after the competition, it is highly recommended to carefully look through registration data at least once before the competition. Below we address the most common issues with registration data:

- Make sure that all names are correctly capitalized and complete (see below).
- Make sure that all people have registered with reasonable dates of birth (e.g. not 01/01/1900 or dd/mm/2020). Remember that the registration data of every newcomer should be checked before they compete at the competition that you are delegating. So please make sure that the name, the date of birth and the citizenship all match the ones from your registration data!
- People registering in person at the competition are particularly error-prone. Pay special attention to those, otherwise you might end up lacking crucial information such as WCA-IDs and/or dates of birth.
- If you still end up missing the date of birth for a competitor, please change it to be blank on the user’s account and do **not** enter bogus dates such as "1900-01-01". Make sure to mention the issue to the Results Team when submitting.
- Make sure that all the data of all returners (competitors with WCA-ID) matches their data currently stored in the WCA database. If there is any difference and a correction is needed, please mention this when submitting the results.
- Make sure that all newcomers are real newcomers. If you are absolutely certain that someone competed before, add their WCA-ID before submission. You can do this by editing their account and manually assign a WCA-ID to them. If you get an error about mismatching data, double check with the competitor that they are indeed a returner, and you will need to contact the results team to correct it. But if there are any doubts, do not add a WCA-ID and mention the issue to the Results Team when submitting.

On abbreviations in competitor names:

- Competitor names are required to contain a **full last name** (as noted on a person's legal document) and reasonable first (nick)name they can be called by.
- The name of the competitor must be roman-readable. Competitors are allowed to have the locally written name if they wish. The localized version must go in parenthesis and after the roman-readable name. Example: Baiqiang Dong (董百强)
- Double letter abbreviations such as "AJ", "TJ", etc. are permitted as first or middle (nick)name if a competitor wishes to be called accordingly.
- Single letter abbreviations ("A.", "B.", etc.) for first and last names are not permitted.
- Second first names / middle names can be abbreviated if desired.
- Note: Competitors that prefer to be called by their second first name are permitted to use this as reasonable first (nick)name.

Examples corresponding to the list above:

- Permitted: "Luis J. Iáñez", "Luis Javier Iáñez", "Javier Iáñez", "LJ Iáñez"
- **Not** permitted: "L. J. Iáñez", "L. Javier Iáñez", "Luis Javier I.", "L. J. I."

### Scoretaking during the competition {.page-break-before}

Scoretakers should be instructed to alert a Delegate if any of the following happen:

- A scorecard is missing a signature. The Delegate should find the competitor and/or judge to rectify the missing signature. Otherwise, the attempt must be recorded as DNF.
- A scorecard does not have the correct number of attempts on it. The Delegate should find the competitor to investigate the cause. They should let the competitor complete their missing solves or remove the attempts that were not supposed to happen.
- A scorecard has ‘DNS’ written on it. The Delegate should find the competitor and clarify if DNS is the correct ruling (failed timer starts are often wrongly recorded as ‘DNS’ by inexperienced judges).
- The round is over and there are more competitors without results than there are empty scorecards. The Delegate should find out whose scorecard is missing.

### Checking competition results before submission

**Ensuring the integrity of all results is one of the main goals of the WCA!** Delegates should make all reasonable efforts to make sure that the results they submit are representative of what happened at the competition. In particular, **you should also always check for**:

- **Registration data**: You have to verify that all issues related to registration data have been resolved (see the Administering registration data section). If this has already been done before the competition as recommended, no bigger issues are expected at this stage.
- **Score taking errors**: You should always double-check each and every scorecard by comparing it with the results entered. This can happen during or after the competition is finished, but always **before** submitting the results (help from reliable organizers or volunteers can be enrolled). When doing this, don't forget to check for [Regulation A7c+](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#A7c+), check for missing signatures, check if extra attempts were entered at their correct position, etc.
- **Cutoffs**: If people do not meet the cutoff for a combined round, their further results have to be blank and they will have no average result. But often, e.g. if the organizer forgot to set a cutoff or to synchronize with WCA Live, the results will contain no visible combined round but a lot of DNS results instead. Make sure to correct such occurrences before submitting the results!
- **Time limits**: Judges are not always aware of the time limits of a round and such times often get entered by the score takers. But when checking the competition results after the competition, the times that exceeded the time limits must be changed to DNF (according to [Regulation A1a4+](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#A1a4+), e.g. a 5:03.48 Megaminx result, while the time limit for the round was 5 minutes).
- **Cumulative time limits**: Make sure that the round format is correct (ie. not using a cutoff) and that all times for a cumulative do not sum up to exceed the limit.

### Compiling Competition Results

The [WCA Scrambles Matcher](https://scrambles-matcher.worldcubeassociation.org/) should be used to match scrambles with the competition results. If using WCA Live, you must synchronize the results before using the WCA Scramble Matcher by clicking the synchronize button on the admin page. The synchronize button must also be used if any subsequent changes have been made to registration data, otherwise they will not be included in the results submission.

The Scrambles Matcher allows you to import results from a multitude of resources, including a workbook, WCA Live, or WCIF. Once the competition’s results are opened, you can then upload the scrambles for the competition. This can be done by selecting “Upload Scrambles JSON” and going inside the unzipped scrambles folder and in the “Interchange” folder to select the .json file. If multiple scramble files were used, you can upload each of them. Once uploaded, select each event to assign scrambles to specific rounds and remove any unused scrambles. **Make sure to double-check the assignments for every event to ensure that all the scrambles that were used are assigned correctly!**

Once done, you can export the results file in JSON format for submission.

### Submitting competition results

Once obtained, the JSON export is to be submitted to the WCA Results Team by uploading it on the WCA website. But **before submitting the results**, you are required to:

- **Modify the events tab with any changes, such as adjusting a cutoff, or adding a round.**
- **Modify the schedule tab to ensure every round is placed on its correct day.**

After updating events and schedule, you can go to the WCA page of your competition ([https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/YOUR-COMPETITION-ID](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/YOUR-COMPETITION-ID)), and submit the competition results using the result submission form. The link to the form also appears as "Submit results" in the left menu as soon as the first day of your competition has started.

You will need to attach and click “submit”. Then, the page will perform a series of checks on the file you submitted. The checks may result in a series of errors and/or warnings being outputted. You must fix all errors and eventually submit an error-free JSON export (see below). For warnings, you should only fix those that you agree with. **However, all remaining warnings must each be addressed in your message to the Results Team (see further below)!**

There are a couple of errors and warnings that you might experience when uploading the JSON export to WCA, many of which are self-explaining. For some selected common ones, we list the probable causes and what you should do to fix them:

- **Unexpected results for an event** This will happen if the results contain an event that was not officially listed for the competition. You will need to appeal to the WCA Board who will either add the event or not allow the addition.
- **Missing results for an event** This will happen one of 2 ways. If you have an event listed and nobody competed in the event. You will need the Results Team to remove the event in order to upload your results. This can also happen if there were any errors in the WA or if you directly modified the JSON export. If this happened, you will need to go back into the WA, fix all errors (as you should have already done earlier!) and create a new valid JSON export. If you are still receiving this error, you will need to contact the Results Team.
- **Unexpected/Missing Results for a round** You will need to modify the events tab with what happened at the competition.
- **Unexpected/Missing Scrambles for a round** You will need to double check the WA to ensure that all scrambles intended to be used are checked.
- **Unexpected/Missing Scrambles for a group** You will need to modify the events tab with the correct number of groups that happened at the competition.
- **The number of persons in the competition (%{n_competitors}) is above the competitor limit** You will need to remove the competitors above the limit or to appeal to the WCA Regulations Committee (WRC) and request the limit to be changed retroactively.
- **Wrong country/name for person** You will need to correct the data for the person. If there is a country/name change request, please include all required information for such cases as described below to the Results Team.
- Any regulation error must be rectified.

After fixing all errors and all relevant warnings, you have to include a message to the Results Team. As already stated earlier, all remaining warnings **must** each be addressed (the Results Team will not upload the results otherwise). As a remaining warning means that you did not take any action to resolve it (probably for a very good reason), simply explain why in sufficient detail. In addition, here are some items you should also list in the message:

- Are there any name changes requested? If so, please list the WCA-ID, old name, new name, and which version of the name is included in the submitted JSON file.
- Are dates of birth missing or are you unsure if a WCA-ID is missing? (see sections above)
- Have rounds or entire events been dropped during the competition?
- Are there records that should be declined due to regulation 9i2)?
- What was the main event at the competition? This relates to the results announcement. In particular, for competitions not hosting 3x3x3, it should always be mentioned if another event should be considered as the competition's main event or not. If no note about this is added, the Results Team will always consider 3x3x3 as main event for competitions with 3x3x3 and 'no main event' for competitions without 3x3x3. (Note: Main events other than 3x3x3 should be recognizable from competition website and time schedule. Otherwise, the Results Team may decide to not consider proposed main events for the result announcement.)
- If this is not the first JSON export that you upload for this competition, please explain what has changed compared to your previous upload.
- Anything else that is of importance for the Results Team? Please don't hesitate to include it; the more detailed, the better.

### Requesting changes to competition results

If changes are requested, the following information must be provided (via "reply all" in the existing results email thread of the competition):

- Competition name or competition ID
- **WCA-ID** and name of the competitor
- Event and round
- Time(s) to be changed - please provide both old and new times for maximum clarity!

Here is an example of a proper change request corresponding to the list above:

- Competition: Example Open 2016 (ID: Example2016)
- Competitor: Jane Doe (**2016DOEJ01**)
- Pyraminx, First Round
- 3rd attempt: **6.79** instead of 6.97
- 5th attempt: **7.32** instead of 5.32

**Note:**

- If you miss to provide all above information, the Results Team will likely ask you to resend a complete change request. **Especially the WCA-ID, which is the unique key to identify competitors in the WCA database, must never be missing!**
- All results changes should be sent via **reply all** to the original results thread where you submitted the json of the competition.
- If the change stems from a clerical mistake, e.g. a mistake during data entry, just mailing the Results Team is enough. If, however, the change arises from video analysis or any other new information, the WRC should be included. In general, the Results Team will always make sure that all relevant teams/committees are added to a conversation.
- For significant changes, e.g. retroactive disqualification of results, Delegates are advised to inform the affected competitor(s) by mail or chat before sending the change request to the Results Team.

## Requesting changes to person data

_(updated on October 15, 2023)_

There are several cases for change requests concerning person data (which involves name, gender, date of birth and citizenship of a competitor). The Results Team has different requirements depending on different circumstances.

There are two different types of data changes:

1. **Fix**: A fix changes a person's data for all past and future competitions and is not visible on a competitor’s profile. This form of data change is commonly applied for:
- Correction of previously incorrect data.
- Minor nickname changes (e.g. removal/addition of middle names, changing a legal first name to a reasonable nickname, etc.)
- Changes of a sensitive nature where displaying the previous data is understandably not desirable (e.g. name/gender changes related to gender identity)

2. **Update**: An update internally creates a new sub-profile, so that the previous data remains unchanged for all past competitions and is also shown on the competitor’s profile. One famous example of this can be found [here](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/1982FRID01). This form of data change is commonly applied for:
- Changes of citizenship
- Major name changes of a non-sensitive nature (e.g. last name changes due to marriage)

Changes in a competitor’s information can be requested directly by the competitor or through the WCA Delegate. If the competitor contacts the Results Team directly, a legal document of identification must be provided. If the Delegate is making the request, the Delegate must verify the competitor is the correct person and that the information provided is correct (e.g. dates of birth, last names) or at least sensible (e.g. first name or gender changes). Moreover:

- Date of birth fixes can be requested by the competitor through the [Birthday Change Request Form](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/contact/dob).
- Name changes: be sure to request the correct type (*fix* or *update*) as per the description above.
- Changes in gender: the Results Team is more lenient with these and only requires proof of identity. Note: As described earlier, since gender changes are mostly sensitive, the Results Team executes such changes (that are technically updates) as fixes.
- All changes sent to the Results Team must at least include **WCA-ID, old data, and new data** and should also contain a concise explanation of the circumstances of the request (if not obvious).

Changes in citizenship are particularly delicate as they affect rankings, and possibly records. Therefore, such requests must include the following:

- Documentation of the old nationality (if available)
- Documentation of the new nationality
- A thorough description of the change request including answers to the following questions:
  - Does the competitor still hold the old nationality (as a dual nationality)?
  - If not: When did the competitor lose the old nationality? Did the competitor ever hold the old nationality?
  - When did the competitor obtain the new nationality?
- **Note:** residing in a country is **not** equivalent to having citizenship for that country.

Final remark: the rules for competitor names described in the Administering registration data section do of course also apply for name changes.

## On submitting competition reports

_(updated on March 1, 2019)_

We believe that reports are a valuable learning opportunity for new Delegates and therefore ask for them to be sent to the Delegates’ mailing list. Since all Board members are in said mailing list, this complies with regulation 1c1). Competition reports must filled out and submitted via the WCA website within one week of the competition. The link to the competition report form is: [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/YOUR-COMPETITION-ID/report](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/YOUR-COMPETITION-ID/report) where you replace YOUR-COMPETITION-ID with the ID of your competition. You can also easily access the form over the "My competitions" page.\
This form sends an email to [reports@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:reports@worldcubeassociation.org) with the competition report.\
We encourage Delegates to write careful, detailed reports for the benefit of all Delegates, and we also encourage new Delegates to read other Delegates' reports carefully and make the most of this learning opportunity.

## Paying competition Dues

(added on April 10, 2019)

All competitions that are WCA official must (bar some exceptions) pay a small fee as part of the [Dues System](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Dues%20System.pdf).

Before the competition, both the Delegates and organisers should be aware of the cost and can therefore budget for an estimated fee that they will be liable to pay once results are uploaded.

Upon results for a competition being uploaded by the WRT, the WFC will issue an invoice within a few days - it may not be sent instantly as it relies on the export being updated. This invoice will arrive **only via email** - there is no WCA website integration at this time.

Please note, due to limitations with the software, **only the first listed Delegate** will receive the invoice. Upon request we can amend who the invoice is issued to, for this we will require the name of the person or organisation how it should be shown on the invoice, and also the email for the contact. Once the invoice has been amended it will be emailed to the new contact.

As the invoice contact, it is your duty to inform other Delegates for the competition about the invoice being owed, and also to communicate with the WFC on behalf of this invoice. This person may also send the invoice onto the organisation team, another Delegate, an association treasurer, etc. If forwarding onto someone else to pay, we would highly recommend requesting confirmation from them once payment has been made. There is a payment period of 30 days, invoices must be paid within this timeframe otherwise there may be repercussions.

If you ever have any doubts, questions, etc. then feel free to send an email to [finance@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:finance@worldcubeassociation.org) who will get back to you as soon as possible.

## Administering WCA user accounts

_(updated on November 10, 2019)_

A while ago, the WCA Software Team introduced WCA website accounts. All WCA Delegates have the authority to manage WCA website accounts, which can be done via "Manage users" in your user menu. These accounts must not be confused with the WCA profiles that contain a person's results (although there is some connection as described later) and mainly fulfil the following purposes:

1. Registering for WCA competitions using the WCA registration system.
2. Managing one's user profile (e.g. profile pictures, mail notifications, etc.)
3. Authentication of WCA members towards the WCA.

It is important to differentiate between WCA user accounts without assigned WCA-ID and WCA user accounts with assigned WCA-ID. A WCA user account without assigned WCA-ID exists independently from all other data. Every Delegate is able to change such an account's data, including name, citizenship and date of birth. However, a WCA user account with assigned WCA-ID is directly connected to the data which is stored in the WCA database for this specific WCA-ID. Therefore, such an account's data can no longer be modified by a Delegate and every false data in such an account means that there is wrong data in the WCA database. In such a case, the WCA Results Team has to be notified (see section Requesting changes to person data above).

### Handling WCA-ID claim requests

Every WCA member can get their WCA-ID assigned to their WCA user account by claiming it. To affect a claim request, the WCA member has to enter the date of birth stored in the WCA database and to select a WCA Delegate who shall take care of this request. If the entered date of birth is incorrect that means that the data stored in the WCA database is either missing or false and this requires a change request to the WCA Results Team (see again section _Requesting changes to person data_ above).

**Note:** Even though WCA Delegates are able to edit user account data (via [Manage users](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/users)), assigning a WCA-ID directly is only possible if the account data matches the profile data of the WCA-ID. Apart from preventing WCA-IDs assigned to wrong use accounts, this ensures that WCA Delegates cannot bypass a change request to the WCA Results Team which is an opportunity for the WCA to correct missing or incorrect data of our members.

If the claim request is submitted successfully, the selected WCA Delegate will be notified and asked to approve the request.

**Note:** Since an assigned WCA-ID means that a person can authenticate him/her towards the WCA, it is very important to handle these requests in a responsible and conscious way. In order to approve a WCA-ID claim request, a WCA Delegate should either find the used mail address matching with former registration data of that WCA member or ask for some other proof of identity. You should never approve a WCA-ID claim request if you are not sure that the person claiming the WCA-ID really is the person owning the WCA-ID in question!

Furthermore, you should not reveal information about a person to someone who claims to be that person. This may seem obvious, but it's easy to be tricked: Sometimes, a user will claim a WCA ID that is already taken, and they want to know what email address has claimed it already so they can try to log in with that. Similarly, we have some WCA accounts requesting IDs where the registration email on the external competition website (e.g. CubingUSA) doesn't match the WCA account email, and they ask for the email address that was used on that external website. It is not appropriate to divulge this information until you have verified this person's identity in some other way.

For some cases, it might be desired to forward a claim request to a different WCA Delegate or to remove the request entirely. The former can simply be done by forwarding the notification mail to the other WCA Delegate. The latter can be achieved by clearing the WCA-ID field of the user account and then clicking "Save". The corresponding notification will then go away.

It is important to handle these requests as expeditiously as you can. You may either approve the request, forward the request to another Delegate, or simply clear the request.

## Acquiring competition equipment

_(updated on September 11, 2023)_

The WCA has negotiated discounted prices for competition equipment from Speed Stacks. All delegates (including Trainee Delegates) as well as [WCA-recognized Regional Organizations](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/organizations), are permitted to place and receive equipment orders. Here is the current price list:

- Tournament Display (includes stand, cord, and AC adapter): $90.00
- StackMat G5 (timer, mat, bag): $24.50
- G5 Timer Only: $18.00
- G5 Mat Only: $8.80
- Extra Data Cord: $3.00
- Extra AC Adapter: $3.00

Prices do not include taxes and shipping, which would add somewhere around $15-30 per box (their largest box fits 5 display sets).

Speed Stacks ships only within the US and Canada. Delegates in other countries can use a third-party mail forwarding service to send the equipment to their country. If you need the invoice for customs purposes, please let WMT know and one will be provided.

To place an order, submit the [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc594bJA55CahKr7F8P-oHK44tn0cZ9NBZst0H5udwKnmh9Og/viewform) with the equipment you want, the shipping address you want it sent to, and the person or organization who will be invoiced for the equipment. After placing the order, a member of the WCA Marketing Team will contact you to confirm the order contents and the recipient's mailing address, and then place the order with Speed Stacks on your behalf. Once the order ships, You will receive an invoice from the WFC, which you can pay via Stripe, PayPal, or bank transfer.

Once you receive your equipment, and before using it in a competition, you should check that everything is in working order. If there are any issues, respond in the email thread with WMT. Once equiment has been used in a competition, it is harder to get a replacement.

Finally, respond to the email thread with WMT to confirm that you have received the equipment and that everything is in working order, so that they can close out your order.

## Recommending a Delegate

_(updated on September 11, 2023)_

The following steps should be completed to appoint a new WCA Delegate:

1. Recommend a person to your Senior and Regional Delegate with a reason for why this person should be a Delegate and why the region needs a Delegate
1. If the Senior Delegate and Regional Delegate agree, then the Senior Delegate will fill out the application form and submit it to the WCA Board
1. If the Board approves the application, the Senior Delegate will have the new Trainee Delegate agree to and sign the [Code of Conduct](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf) and [Code of Ethics](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf), as well as disclose any potential conflicts of interest
1. The Trainee Delegate must add a profile picture to their WCA account, if they do not already have one
1. The Senior Delegate will then update the new Trainee Delegate's status on the WCA website
1. The Trainee Delegate must then send a short introduction email to the Board (and their regional delegate mailing list if they want to)

After all the above steps are completed, the new Trainee Delegate can begin their duties!

## Business Cards

_(updated on September 8, 2023)_

Delegates are the face of the WCA, and are the staff members whom most members of the public will interact with. A WCA Delegate often needs to introduce themselves to new people both inside and outside of a competition, and it is useful to have business cards to hand out. The WCA has a business card template that Delegates can use to print their own business cards, and includes a QR code that links to a LinkTree page with various WCA resources.

The templates are designed for use with VistaPrint, which is available in the US, Canada, and many countries in Europe. If you are in a country where VistaPrint is not available, you can use the template to create your own business cards with a local printing service.

The following are steps to create a business card using VistaPrint. Screenshots of each step are available [here](https://imgur.com/a/i28RZmo).

1. Download the business card assets from the [WMT Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QG4Zg5vGTzxzwMxEkLmFvtM0iV_KhIC1). _Note: only staff members with a WCA email address can access this link._
1. Go to [https://www.vistaprint.com/business-cards](https://www.vistaprint.com/business-cards)
1. Go to "Upload Design", choose "Standard Horizontal" for style, and upload "wcaCardBackground.png"
1. Click "Make more edits" on the bottom
1. Using the font Catamaran and the reference images as a guide, position four text boxes with the following text:

   World Cube Association _(Size 8, Bolded)_  
   [Delegate Name] _(Size 11, Bolded)_  
   Junior/Full Delegate _(Size 8, Not Bolded)_  
   [Delegate's WCA Email] _(Size 8, Not Bolded)_

   If the font Catamaran does not support your language, you can use a different font. The font should be sans-serif and legible. Contact WMT if you need assistance choosing an appropriate font.

1. Add "wcaLogo.png" as an image and position it using the reference image as a guide
1. Add local/regional information on the back (optional)
1. Once purchased, this cost can be reimbursed using competition funds
