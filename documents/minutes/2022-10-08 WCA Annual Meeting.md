#### **EXECTUTIVE DIRECTOR'S ACTIVITY STATEMENT** {.text-center}

The Executive Director thanked all members for their attendance, as well as community members watching via stream.

He noted that this year marked a strong year of returning to competing with over 28000 competitors in 712 competitions and a further 228 competitions announced for later in the year.

A key part to the year was having held 4 continental championships, with another one underway and the last one to be held at the end of the year. Thanks to the organizers for their work in making these competitions happen, as well as Rubik's for their role in sponsorship towards these competitions.

The WCA looks forward to continuing a strong relationship that has been formed in the interest of promoting speedcubing to a wider audience. As competitions begin to grow around the world, the WCA faces new challenges. Being able to scale up our systems in order to cope with an increased demand is a key focus in order to ensure the future success of the organization.

The Board looks forward to being able to welcoming all Staff and community members in Seoul in 2023 for the first WCA World Championship since 2019. The return of a place for cubers from around the world to gather is an event we are very much looking forward to.

The report was provided to all attendees and is available on the organization's website.
