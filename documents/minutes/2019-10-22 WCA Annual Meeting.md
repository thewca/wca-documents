The Board welcomed the attendees to the first annual meeting of the World Cube Association and invited the Senior Delegates and Leaders of Committees and Teams to introduce themselves.

This Chair explains this meeting will be an opportunity for Committee’s and Teams to share updates regarding their current activities.

#### VISION & STRATEGY OF THE WCA {.text-center}

The WCA Board met to discuss the Mission and Strategy of the association of which a document was created and shared with the members of the association. This project has been developed over the past year to plan where the organization will be moving over the short and long term future. The chair notes the interesting nature of the long standing history of the WCA while only being official since 2017. The chair notes both the growth in size of the organization and the need to meet certain regulatory requirements as important factors when considering the future of the organization. The Board expects continued growth in the short term however within the next 5 years the organization may experience slowed growth. Over the long term we are currently relying on the WCA Dues Policy which continues to fund our organizations activities. The Board would like to focus on the following four cornerstones regarding the vision and strategy: People, Partnership, Quality and Technology. The Chair invited any questions regarding the WCA Board’s proposal for the vision and strategy of the organization for the short and long term future. The Treasurer elaborates on the current financial position of the organization and the Board wishes for best allocation of these funds to allow for growth within the organization.

#### REDUCTION OF BUREAUCRACY WITHIN WCA {.text-center}

The Board notes that there have been complaints regarding the increased bureaucracy of the organization. Unfortunately, it is noted that a large amount of change has been required as the organization becomes recognized as a registered entity and experiences a quick growth in its size. The Board at the moment does not have any idea to reduce these processes while keeping an organization of this size manageable. The Chair invited any ideas for reduction of bureaucracy within the processes. 

#### STATUS OF THE GEAR TEAM WITHIN THE WMT {.text-center}

The Chair noted that the gear team transitioned into the Marketing team a few months ago. Up until recently international orders were not possible however the organization has signed up for a USPS account which will allow for international orders to be fulfilled. It is noted that there has been some issues with the shipment account which brought the international shipping to a temporary stop. Several orders have been stalled since July and the organization is working on applying for a business account with USPS which should allow for international shipping to resume in the short term future. The goal is to have the remainder of the stalled international orders out within the coming months.

#### ADDITION OF CHAMPIONSHIP FEATURES TO THE WCA WEBSITE {.text-center}

Recent championships have been using a seperate website to handle registrations due to the limited nature of registration possibilities on the website. The Board would like to see all competition use the WCA Website for registration however noting the current deficiencies in the current website which would make this impractical. The Board noted the current lack of productivity in terms of completion of software projects 

#### CODE OF CONDUCT {.text-center}

Lucas Garron (WRC Leader) explained that he was leading a project into creating a code of conduct for the WCA. So far a working team has formed from several committee’s and a meeting has been held to begin the planning phase. The project is currently on hold while the regulations committee is handling more time pressing tasks. It was noted that the leadership of this project may be handed over to Lorenzo Vigani Poli (WDC Leader)

#### WRC PRIORITIES {.text-center}

Lucas Garron (WRC Leader) begins by apologising for the communication of potential changes to the regulations. The regulations are currently in a feedback phase and they are definitely open to change before the final set of changes is made. He noted the community survey was proposed to collect thoughts on changes to the regulations, unfortunately this project has been delayed due to the large size of the current form of the survey. He invited thoughts regarding a good focus for the community survey at the current point of time. He noted the large workload on the committee as they are required to read every Delegate report which makes their workload quite high and unsustainable. Lucas also notes the large gap between unofficial and official events and explains that it is a current project of the committee to address this divide and potentially reduce the gap. Lucas invited any questions about the priorities of the committee.

#### HALL OF FAME {.text-center}

The Board received a proposal from Daniel Sheppard (WAC Leader) to evaluate a hall of fame for the organization. There has not been much progress and discussion will be brought up with the relevant committees and teams regarding the matter

#### ADJOURNMENT {.text-center}

The meeting was closed at 9:40 p.m. with no further business. The next annual meeting will be held via online means in the month of October, 2020.
