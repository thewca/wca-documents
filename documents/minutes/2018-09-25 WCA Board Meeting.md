#### **NON-PROFIT PROGRESS** {.text-center}

Form 1023 to be recognized as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization was filed 4 months ago and we are waiting for the IRS to come back to us by letter. Form CT-1 with the California Registry of Charitable Trusts was filed too and we are already recognized as a charity in California. Once we receive the determination letter from the IRS, we will send it to the California Registry of Charitable Trusts, and we will file Form 3500A with the California Franchise Tax Board.

#### **REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS** {.text-center}

We will follow up with all Regional Organizations that haven’t got back to us yet with all the required information letting them know that the grace period granted on the Board Meeting of January 16, 2018, is ending in three months, and that their recognition as a WCA Regional Organization will be withdrawn at that time if they don’t follow up.

A mailing list has been created with the purpose of improving and strengthening the communication between Regional Organization Boards and the WCA Board, and all Board members of WCA Regional Organizations have been asked to join. At the moment of the meeting, the list has fifty one members members, including the four WCA Board members.

#### **COMPETITION REQUIREMENTS POLICY** {.text-center}

We discussed the soon-to-be WCA Competition Requirements Policy, and what should it contain. We will propose to the WCA Regulations Committee that all the Regulations and Guidelines which aren’t of interest for Registered Speedcubers - i.e. specific Regulations for Delegates and/or Organizers - are put into a policy instead.

#### **WCA WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 2019** {.text-center}

We decided that the name of the WCA World Championship 2019, or any WCA-branded competition hereafter, must not contain any other brand as a part of it.

#### **WCA NORTH AMERICAN CHAMPIONSHIP 2020** {.text-center}

The decision about holding or not the WCA North American Championship 2020 has been postponed until shortly before the application period for all other 2020 WCA Continental Championships starts. All North American Delegates will be asked once again to share their thoughts regarding this competition before any decision is made.

#### **FURTHERANCE** {.text-center}

The WCA Financial Committee is working on a policy to reimburse Delegates for their trips to new countries and regions, and will also draft a policy to pay for equipment to communities in need. Once completed, the policies will be shared with the WCA Board for feedback and review. The WCA Quality Assurance Committee will be asked to investigate which communities could benefit the most of free or subsidized equipment.

#### **WCA DUES** {.text-center}

The WCA Financial Committee has collected approximately $10,000 so far this year, with about $2,000 additionally outstanding. The WCA Financial Committee is currently developing a template to chase Delegates who have outstanding dues.

#### **BOARD TRANSPARENCY** {.text-center}

A strategy document is being drafted with the aim to better communicate our priorities and short and mid-term goals and projects in order to pursue our Mission. This document will help clarify the motivation under the decisions that move our organization, improving our transparency.

#### **COMMUNICATION** {.text-center}

Communication within our organization and within all the community is an ongoing problem that it’s been being discussed since some months ago. There are different levels on which the communication has to improve, starting from how we communicate to the wider community and finishing with how we deal with our daily processes. Different systems and platforms are being investigated to try to address all the issues. This topic is a high priority for the WCA Board.

#### **ADJOURNMENT** {.text-center}

There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 3:47 p.m. PST
