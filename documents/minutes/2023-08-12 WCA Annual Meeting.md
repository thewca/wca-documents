### **EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S ACTIVITY STATEMENT {.text-center}**

The Executive Director thanked all members for their attendance, as well as community members watching via stream.

He noted that this year marked a strong year of returning to competing with over 26,020 new competitors in 1,069 competitions across 86 countries.

A key focus area for the fiscal year was to bring the WCA to a financial state which would remove any stress and allow us to better support furtherance expenses in line with our mission and spirit. Our efforts working towards this goal have allowed us to operate with the comfort of being able to meet the increasing fixed costs involved with operating our large organization.

The WCA brought upon two software contractors who are working towards a complete overhaul of our registration system.

The WCA Board has been delighted to partner with Rubik’s/Spin Master as a major corporate partner. In 2022 this partnership allowed the WCA as an organization to deliver a continental championship on all six continents in a year welcoming the return of the European, Asia, and South American Championships. This year also saw the first edition of the African, North American, and Oceanic Championships. The WCA Board looks forward to continuing this partnership over the coming years to strengthen the position of our organization.

The WCA looks forward to continuing a strong relationship with our partners and the 500 staff members that share in the interest of promoting speedcubing to a wider audience. As competitions begin to grow around the world, the WCA faces new challenges. Being able to scale up our systems in order to cope with an increased demand is a key focus in order to ensure the future success of the organization.

The Board would also like to thank everyone who makes WCA events what they are — from local organizers, Delegates, Team and Committee members to competitors who attend the numerous events that are held every weekend. This organization would be far smaller than it is without their hard work and dedication.

The WFC and the WCA Board actively discuss and work towards using these funds to advance the WCA, and we are very excited for what is to come.

The report was provided to all attendees and is available on the organization's website.
