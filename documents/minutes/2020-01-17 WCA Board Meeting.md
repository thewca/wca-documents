The Board discussed the feedback from Staff from the proposed amendments to the Motions.

#### **REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS** {.text-center}

The Board discussed the global structure of Regional Organizations. It was agreed that each country should have no more than one recognized Regional Organization. Each continent may also have a Regional Organization. If an organization serves a region that is only part of a country, it shall be left to the Regional Organization of that country to decide to recognize that organization at its own discretion.

#### **TRADEMARK REGISTRATION** {.text-center}

The Board discussed the incurred legal expenses resulting from the domestic and international trademark registrations of the word and logo marks. It was agreed that these expenses were worthwhile for ensuring global protection of our brand.

#### **SPORTS ORGANIZATION** {.text-center}

The Board discussed the implications of being recognized as a member of the Global Association of International Sports Federations. We determined that we do not yet meet the requirements for membership, but it would be worthwhile to apply when we meet the requirements.

#### **ADJOURNMENT** {.text-center}

There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:11 p.m. UTC.
