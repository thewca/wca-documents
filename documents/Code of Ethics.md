# Code of Ethics

### Version 2.4 {.version}

The Code of Ethics must be considered by all Staff members of the World Cube Association (WCA), referred to in this document as “WCA Staff”, as a standard for actions and decisions they will be making when acting on behalf of the WCA within their role. “Listed Delegates” refers to WCA Delegates who are publicly displayed on the “General info” tab of an official WCA Competition.

These actions and decisions should be made in such a manner that, if consistently performed by WCA Staff, the [Spirit and Mission](wcadoc{documents/motions/01.2021.1 - Spirit.pdf}) of the WCA would continue to be upheld while not breaking any [Regulations](wca{regulations}), [Motions, or Policies](wca{documents}).

This Code covers previously known issues, as well as issues that the WCA Integrity Committee (WIC) foresees as requiring additional guidance. This document will be updated periodically to incorporate new topics as they are brought to the attention of the WIC, and will also be reviewed regularly.

The official communication channel for the WIC is via email. For any concerns about the ethical conduct of a WCA Staff member, contact the WIC: [integrity@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:integrity@worldcubeassociation.org). If there are any concerns about the ethical conduct of the WCA Integrity Committee, either the Committee itself or an individual member, please contact the WCA Appeals Committee (WAC) at: [appeals@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:appeals@worldcubeassociation.org).

         1. Family
         2. Friends

      4. Members of a reasonably formed group may be partially or fully waived from paying the competition’s registration fee.

   4. Listed Delegates must request and review an outlined budget for all of their competitions before announcement. Any concerns in the competition budget should be discussed with an Organizer and/or the people in charge of the competition finances.
