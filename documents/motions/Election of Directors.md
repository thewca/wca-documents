         1. Only the candidates with voting result equal to the voting result of the candidate ranked N can run for the new election.
         2. Tied candidates are not allowed to submit new candidacy documents.
         3. The candidacy period will be reduced to 3 days.
      2. If some candidates withdraw from the new election and there are not more candidates than positions, then the remaining candidates are declared winners without more voting.
9. WCA Board appoints the winners as Directors per the date that was communicated in the election or, if no date was communicated, within 24 hours of the closing of the voting.
