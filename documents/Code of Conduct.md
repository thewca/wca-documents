# Code of Conduct
<div class="version">
### Version 1.0
</div>

The Code of Conduct must be considered by all members of the World Cube Association (WCA) Community, as a standard for actions and behavior. Members of the WCA Community include, but are not limited to: Registered Speedcubers, Competitions Organizers, Guests, WCA Officials, Users on the official WCA Forum. 

These actions should uphold the Spirit and Mission of the WCA while not breaking any Regulations, Motions or Policies. 

Registered Speedcubers who are qualified as “WCA Staff” must also uphold the Code of Ethics as a standard for actions and decisions they will be making when acting on behalf of the WCA within their role. 

This Code covers previously known issues, as well as issues that the WCA foresees as requiring additional guidance. This document will be updated periodically to incorporate new topics as they are brought to the attention of the WCA, and will also be reviewed regularly. 

Disciplinary procedures are handled by the WCA Disciplinary Committee (WDC) as outlined in item 3 of this document.

The official communication channel for the WDC is via email. For any concerns about the conduct of Registered Speedcubers, contact the WDC: disciplinary@worldcubeassociation.org.

      1. that it is their personal responsibility to familiarize themselves with all of the requirements of the Code of Conduct, including what conduct constitutes an offense under the Code of Conduct;
      2. to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any WCA Delegate, WCA Committee or WCA Board of Directors convened under the Disciplinary Procedure to hear and determine charges brought (and any appeals in relation thereto) pursuant to the Code of Conduct; and
      3. not to bring any proceedings to any court or other forum that are inconsistent with the foregoing submission to the jurisdiction of WCA Delegates, WCA Committees or WCA Board.
   2. While taking into account Article 1.1, the WCA and Members of the WCA Community shall be responsible for promoting Code of Conduct awareness and education amongst Members of the WCA Community; in particular WCA Officials.
2. **Conduct**
   1. Every member of the WCA Community must behave with respect towards the representatives of the WCA, other Registered Speedcubers, spectators, press and partners.

      1. Compassion: treat others as you would like to be treated.
      2. Integrity: be honest and compete fairly.
      3. Respect: show respect to all other humans.
   2. Possible violations include, but are not limited to:
