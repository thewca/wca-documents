# WCA Expense Reimbursement Policy
<div class="version">
### Version 1.0
</div>

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to define the conditions under which WCA Staff and External Staff can be reimbursed their expenses originated from travels to assist in our nonprofit activities in support of our Mission.

## Policy
### Allowed Expenses
1. Expenses can only be claimed for competitions in which WCA funded travel is absolutely necessary for the competition to take place. This is ordinarily limited to the Delegate’s travel expenses to countries or remote regions where suitable WCA Staff and/or External Staff are not already available or for countries who are still developing in speedcubing terms.
2. The World Cube Association will only reimburse expenses which are reasonable and necessary for conducting World Cube Association activities, with special limits for travel expenses.
3. The World Cube Association will only reimburse expenses as allowed by federal, state, and local laws for nonprofits.
4. These guidelines form an “accountable plan”, which prevents expense reimbursements from becoming taxable salary.
5. Expense categories include
   1. Staff travel and lodging
   2. Staff meals

### Approval
All expenses must be approved in writing by the WCA Board of Directors in accordance with relevant Policies and other Board decisions. Approval must be sought at least 28 days before the first date of the WCA Competition for which they apply.

### Expense Reimbursement Processes
1. **Receipts are required for all expenses (except mileage)**
   1. Scans or readable digital photos of receipts are sufficient.
   2. Personal car mileage has special logging requirements (see below).
   3. Expenses will not be granted without receipts or mileage logs.
2. Direct expenses
   1. The WFC can make direct payments to third parties.
      1. This is the preferred process for large expenses (e.g. plane tickets).
3. Out of pocket expenses
   1. All out of pocket expense reimbursement requests must be filed with the WFC within 30 days of the transaction, with supporting receipts.
4. Delegated reimbursement
   1. The WFC, Committee/Team Leaders, and Senior Delegates may assist the WCA Treasurer with reimbursements by aggregating expense requests from multiple WCA Staff and/or External Staff.
      1. The applicant must present all relevant receipts to the WFC, with the names of the people who incurred each expense.
      2. The applicant would then be responsible for properly distributing reimbursements they receive from the Treasurer, on behalf of the WCA.
5. Advance payment
   1. The WCA Treasurer may provide an advance from the WCA to help pay for expenses that cannot be directly paid by the WCA for some reason.
      1. Receipts should be submitted for all usage of advance funds within 30 days* of the transaction(s).
      2. All excess funds not documented by receipts must be returned to the WCA within 60 days* of receiving the advance.

* The strict “accountable plan” limits for receipt submission and excess fund return are 60 days and 120 days, respectively, but the WCA requires the tighter deadlines unless there are extenuating circumstances as approved by the WCA Treasurer or the WCA Board of Directors.

### Travel Expenses
