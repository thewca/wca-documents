# WCA AI Usage Guidelines

### Version 1.0 {.version}

## Purpose

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance productivity and results. This document provides guidelines for appropriate AI usage when performing work for the World Cube Association (WCA).

## Data Classification

Before using AI, you must distinguish between the types of information you are handling.

* **Private WCA Information:** Information which is not publicly accessible or published by the WCA. Examples include, but are not limited to: member data, non-public financial records, and internal team or committee communications.
* **Public WCA Information:** Information already in the public domain. Examples include, but are not limited to: WCA Regulations, public documents, published competition results, official announcements, and open-source codebases (e.g., WCA GitHub repositories).

## Guidelines

1. **Tool Selection by Data Type:**
    1. **For Private Information:** You must only use WCA-approved AI tools while logged into your official WCA account. This ensures the data is not used to train external models.
    2. **For Public Information:** You may use any AI tool (including personal licenses or open-source models) to assist with tasks involving public WCA documents or open-source code.
2. **Intellectual Property:** Be cautious when using AI to generate core branding, logos, or legal text. For technical work, ensure AI-generated code snippets do not violate the licenses of the WCA’s open-source projects.
3. **Human-in-the-Loop:** AI output must never be published as an official WCA statement, Regulation, or technical update without being reviewed by a human. Treat AI as a drafter, not an author.
4. **Fact-Checking:** Always verify facts, statistics, and regulation citations. AI can hallucinate competition results or generate non-existent regulations.
5. **WCA Context:** Ensure AI output is adapted for the WCA community. A summary intended for a Delegate report requires a different tone than a social media post or a technical GitHub Pull Request.
6. **Fairness and Bias:** Actively check for and correct biases in AI outputs to ensure they align with the WCA’s commitment to diversity and inclusion.
7. **Prohibited Autonomous Use:** AI shall not be the final decision-maker for critical processes, including disciplinary actions, financial approvals, official Regulation changes, or team/committee decisions.
8. **Accountability:** You are responsible for the final work product you submit or publish, regardless of how much AI was used to generate it.

## Approved AI Tools for Private Information

To maintain data privacy for internal WCA work, the following tools are provided:

* **Google Gemini:** Available via your WCA Google Workspace account. You must be logged in to your WCA Google Account to ensure data protections are active.
* **Zoom AI Companion:** Available for summarizing meetings held on WCA-provided Zoom accounts.
