# WCA AI Usage Guidelines

### Version 1.0 {.version}

## Purpose

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance productivity. This document provides guidelines for appropriate AI usage when performing tasks for the World Cube Association (WCA).

## Data Classification

This section distinguishes the types of information WCA Volunteers may handling.

* **Private WCA Information:** Information which is not publicly accessible or published by the WCA. Examples include, but are not limited to: member data, non-public financial records, and internal team or committee communications.
* **Public WCA Information:** Information already in the public domain. Examples include, but are not limited to: WCA Regulations, public documents, published competition results, official announcements, and open-source codebases (e.g. public WCA GitHub repositories).

## Guidelines

1. **Tool Selection by Data Type:**
    1. **For Private Information:** WCA Volunteers must only WCA-approved AI tools while logged into an official WCA account on the relevant platform. This ensures the data is not used to train external models.
    2. **For Public Information:** WCA Volunteers may use any AI tool (including personal licenses or open-source models) to assist with tasks involving public WCA documents or open-source code.
2. **Intellectual Property:** AI should be used with caution when generating branding, logos, or text. For technical tasks, verify that AI-generated code snippets do not violate the licenses of the WCA’s open-source projects.
3. **Human-in-the-Loop:** AI output must never be published as an official WCA statement, Regulation, or technical update without being reviewed by a human. Treat AI as a drafter, not an author.
4. **Fact-Checking:** Always verify facts, statistics, and regulation citations. AI can hallucinate competition results or generate non-existent regulations.
5. **WCA Context:** Ensure AI output is adapted for the WCA community. A summary intended for a Delegate report requires a different tone than a social media post or a technical GitHub pull request.
6. **Fairness and Bias:** Actively check for and correct biases in AI outputs to ensure they align with the WCA’s commitment to diversity and inclusion.
7. **Prohibited Autonomous Use:** AI shall not be the final decision-maker for critical processes, including disciplinary actions, financial approvals, official Regulations changes, or team/committee decisions.
8. **Accountability:** WCA Volunteers are responsible for the final product they submit or publish, regardless of how much AI was used to generate it.

## Approved AI Tools for Private Information

To maintain data privacy for internal WCA tasks, the following tools are approved:

* **Google Gemini:** Available via a WCA Volunteer's WCA Google Workspace account. One must be logged in to their WCA Google Account to ensure data protections are active.
* **Zoom AI Companion:** Available for summarizing meetings held on WCA-provided Zoom accounts.
