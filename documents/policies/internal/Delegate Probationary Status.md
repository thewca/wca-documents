# WCA Delegate Probationary Status Policy

### Version 1.4 {.version}

## Policy
Delegates who fail to do their duties may be placed on probation. This is an internal designation which only the Delegate on probation, Regional Delegate, Senior Delegate, Board, and relevant committees and/or teams would be aware of.

### Probation Due to Late Reports and/or Results
Delegates who submit late reports and/or results for two consecutive competitions, or Delegates who demonstrate a pattern of late submissions of reports and/or results, shall be subject to the following restrictions.

1. The Delegate will not be permitted to delegate competitions held in the same week or held on consecutive weekends.
   1. Competitions that have already been announced will be unaffected; however, no new competitions which would violate this restriction may be announced.
2. The Delegate will remain on probation until they demonstrate that they are capable of fulfilling their duties by submitting the report and results of at least three consecutive competitions on time.

### Probation Due to Late Payments
Delegates who have late outstanding payments for competition Dues or gear orders may be placed on probation.

1. Unless the Delegate has a valid reason for the late payment (i.e. an exceptional circumstance), as determined by the WFC, then the Delegate will not be allowed to announce any new competitions or place any new gear orders until their outstanding balance is paid.
   1. Competitions that have already been announced and gear orders that have already been shipped will be unaffected.
2. Following the payment of the outstanding balance, the Delegate may be placed on continued probation limiting the number of upcoming competitions they may have announced at any one time and/or their ability to place gear orders, at the discretion of the WFC or Senior Delegate.

### Probation Due to Quality Issues
At the discretion of the Senior Delegate, Delegates may be placed on probation due to quality issues, including, but not limited to:

- Failure to reply to or communicate with WCA Staff members
- Failure to process WCA ID claims in a reasonable timeframe
- Repeated carelessness when submitting competitions for announcement
- Repeated carelessness when submitting competition results or corrections
- Recurring errors in incident calls
- Failure to report incidents that occurred at competitions

At the discretion of the Senior Delegate, Delegates on this type of probation shall be subject to restrictions, including, but not limited to, any or all of the following:

1. The Delegate may not be permitted to delegate competitions without another Delegate (who is not on probation) present at the competition.
2. The Delegate may be restricted to competitions that have a lower competitor limit, set by the Senior Delegate.
3. The Delegate may be required to have the schedule approved by the WQAC and/or Senior Delegate before submitting competitions for announcement.
4. The Delegate may not have any competitions announced until communication is re-established and outstanding issues are resolved.

The Delegate will remain on probation until they demonstrate that they are capable of fulfilling their duties, at the discretion of the Senior Delegate.

### Probation Due to Annual Testing issues
Delegates will be placed on probation due to issues with annual testing, as described in the [WCA Delegate Global Management System]() (WDGMS).

Delegates on this type of probation must not be permitted to delegate competitions without another Delegate (who is not on probation) present at the competition.

The Delegate will remain on probation until they meet the criteria described in point 25.1 of the WDGMS. The Delegate will lose their appointment if they are still on probation by the end of the calendar year.

### Demotion
Delegates on probation who fail to improve in a certain time period, set as a fixed period of time or number of competitions by the Senior Delegate when the probation period begins, may be demoted, at the discretion of the Senior Delegate and with approval by the WCA Board.
