# WCA Payment Authorization Policy

### Version 1.0 {.version}

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the procedures for individual WCA Staff Members to make payments on behalf of the WCA, and to authorize specific individuals. 

## Policy
1. Ability to make Payments
   1. Through the course of of their role, WCA Staff Members may gain the ability to make payments on behalf of the WCA (e.g. explicit access to a bank account or payment card details). This includes abilities with limited scope, such as access to an online service which has WCA payment details pre-linked.
   2. As a general principle, WCA Staff Members should only grant the ability to make payments to other WCA Staff Members sparingly and when it is necessary for them to act in the scope of their role within the WCA.
   3. The posession of payment ability does not authorize individual Staff Members to act in a manner which will cause the WCA to incur costs. 
   4. WCA Staff Members who use their ability to make payments in a manner not in line with the WCA Bylaws, Motions, Policies (including this policy) and/or Codes are considered to have acted outside the scope of their role within the WCA. The WCA reserves the right to take action in line with the WCA Code of Ethics or applicable laws in such an instance. 
2. Authority to make Payments
   1. Specific individual Staff Members, or Staff Members with defined roles, have the authority to make payments.
      1. Where an individual Staff Member is named, the role in which capacity they have authorization is specified. If the WCA Staff Member ceases to hold that role the authorization is considered invalid.
   3. Staff Members with authority may make payments directly, or authorize another WCA Staff Member with payment ability in writing to make the payment on an individual transaction basis.
   4. Payment authorization is split into multiple payment categories, and individuals may have a different payment authorization level for different categories. The payment authorization level applies on a per-transaction basis.
   5. All payments above individual authorization levels must be authorized by the WCA Board.
3. Conflicts of Interest
   1. WCA Staff Members with payment authority may not authorize payment to themselves, an immediate relative, or an organization where they are a director, owner, or involved in the management of finances.
4. Prior to authorizing a payment, individuals with payment authority must:
   1. Determine the payment category;
   2. Ensure the payment complies with (as applicable) the WCA Bylaws, the WCA Motions, WCA Policies, and/or the most recent applicable WCA Board approved budget;
   3. Ensure that the payment has necessary documentation;
   4. Ensure that they (the individual making the payment) do not have a conflict of interest; and,
   5. Ensure that the payment is within their authorized payment level for that individual and payment category.
