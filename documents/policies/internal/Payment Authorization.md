# WCA Payment Authorization Policy

### Version 1.4 {.version}

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the procedures for individual WCA Volunteers to make payments on behalf of the WCA, and to authorize specific individuals. 

## Policy
1. Ability to make Payments
   1. Through the course of their role, WCA Volunteers may gain the ability to make payments on behalf of the WCA (e.g. explicit access to a bank account or payment card details). This includes abilities with limited scope, such as access to an online service which has WCA payment details pre-linked.
   2. As a general principle, WCA Volunteers should only grant the ability to make payments to other WCA Volunteers sparingly and when it is necessary for them to act in the scope of their role within the WCA.
   3. The possession of payment ability does not authorize individual WCA Volunteers to act in a manner which will cause the WCA to incur costs. 
   4. WCA Volunteers who use their ability to make payments in a manner not in line with the WCA Bylaws, Motions, Policies (including this policy) and/or Codes are considered to have acted outside the scope of their role within the WCA. The WCA reserves the right to take action in line with the WCA Code of Ethics or applicable laws in such an instance. 
2. Authority to make Payments
   1. WCA Volunteers with defined roles or those specified in Appendix A, have the authority to make payments.
      1. Where an individual WCA Volunteer is named, the role in which capacity they have authorization is specified. If the WCA Volunteer ceases to hold that role, the authorization is considered invalid.
   3. WCA Volunteers with authority may make payments directly, or authorize another WCA Volunteer with payment ability in writing to make the payment on an individual transaction basis.
   4. Payment authorization is split into multiple payment categories, and individuals may have a different payment authorization level for different categories. The payment authorization level applies on a per-transaction basis.
   5. All payments above individual authorization levels must be authorized by the WCA Board.
3. Conflicts of Interest
   1. WCA Volunteers with payment authority may not authorize payment to themselves, an immediate relative, or an organization where they are a director, owner, or involved in the management of finances.
4. Prior to authorizing a payment, individuals with payment authority must:
   1. Determine the payment category;
   2. Ensure the payment complies with (as applicable) the WCA Bylaws, the WCA Motions, WCA Policies, and/or the most recent applicable WCA Board approved budget;
   3. Ensure that the payment has necessary documentation;
   4. Ensure that they (the individual making the payment) do not have a conflict of interest; and,
   5. Ensure that the payment is within their authorized payment level for that individual and payment category.
