## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the guidelines and requirements of individual user accounts and group accounts on the worldcubeassociation.org domain. This policy applies to all WCA Staff members and anyone else who is assigned (or given access to) a corporate email. Since Staff who use WCA email are representing the World Cube Association, they must be aware that they represent the WCA whenever they send emails from such an account.

## Policy
All WCA Staff must have a valid email address linked to an account on worldcubeassociation.org. This account is assigned by a G Suite administrator and must be claimed and linked before the Staff member is appointed on the WCA website.

### Appropriate Use
Staff are required to use their WCA email for all official World Cube Association related business. Staff must adhere to this policy at all times. Staff must also adhere to all confidentiality and data protection guidelines. Staff may use their email to:

- Communicate as an organizer of WCA Competitions
- Sign up or log in to services related to work as a WCA Staff member
- Sign up for newsletters, platforms, or other services that will help them with their role as a WCA Staff member

### Inappropriate Use

- Intentionally spam other people’s emails, including other Staff members

### Personal Use
