# WCA Dues System
### Version 1.0

The WCA Dues System is a policy by which the WCA will collect revenue on a per-competitor-per-competition basis from WCA Delegates in order to further the Mission and the Spirit of the WCA. The policy intends that WCA Delegates will fund the amount owed either by charging registration fees to their competitors, to the competition sponsors, or by using some other means of collecting money on behalf of their respective countries.

1. Any WCA Delegate who hosts a competition will be responsible for paying Dues after the competition has finished.
2. WCA Delegates are ultimately responsible for Dues being paid on time and in full.
   - 2.1. Delegates may allow the competition organizers or other official organization to pay the Dues on their behalf.
3. After a WCA Delegate submits the results for their competition and the results are posted by the WRT, the WCA Financial Committee will send the Delegate an invoice detailing the total Due amount owed.
   - 3.1. WCA Delegates will have 7 days to pay the invoice counting from the time the invoice was sent.
   - 3.2. If payment is not received by 7 days, the Delegate is considered late on their dues payment.
      - 3.2.1. Delegates who are not able to pay their Dues within 7 days should contact the WFC with a reason why payment cannot be made on time.
         - 3.2.1.1. On a case-by-case basis the WFC will evaluate if the Delegate is experiencing an exceptional circumstance for why payment cannot be made on time. In such cases, special accommodations may be made on a one-time basis.
         - 3.2.1.2. If Delegates do not have a valid reason for the late payment (i.e. an exceptional circumstance), then the Delegate will not be allowed to announce any new competitions as Delegate until their outstanding balance is paid. (Exception: 3x3x3 Fewest Moves simultaneous competitions are handled differently. See Appendix B).
      - 3.2.2. Delegates with chronically late payments will be referred to their Senior Delegates for follow-up to ensure that future Dues are received on time.
   - 3.3. WCA Delegates may pay the Due amount using either PayPal or Stripe.
      - 3.3.1. Details for how to make these payments will be included in the invoice sent to the Delegate.
4. The Due amount owed for a competition will be calculated on a
per-competitor-per-competition basis.
   - 4.1. Each competition will have a per-competitor Due amount owed.
   - 4.2. The total amount owed for the competition will be the per-competitor Due amount owed multiplied by the number of competitors who participated in the competition.
   - 4.3. For a more detailed explanation of how the Due amount owed is calculated by the WFC, please refer to Appendix A.

## Appendix A
### Detailed description of how per-competitor due amounts are calculated
To calculate the Due amount owed for a competition, the following procedure will be used:

1. The country used to determine the Due amount owed is the country in which the competition takes place.
   - 1.1. For 3x3x3 Fewest Moves simultaneous competitions, please see Appendix B for how to calculate the Due amount owed.
2. Countries will be grouped together into 6 Bands based on their Cost of Living values. <br> Countries are assigned to a band according to the following list: <br> [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17NAiX46eeIwA2MpW-czo-CYKNjocvQfj_uCE1jRhh_Q](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17NAiX46eeIwA2MpW-czo-CYKNjocvQfj_uCE1jRhh_Q).
3. To determine the price per-competitor for a competition, look up the competition’s band, then find its per-competitor price using the following list: <br> [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17NAiX46eeIwA2MpW-czo-CYKNjocvQfj_uCE1jRhh_Q](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17NAiX46eeIwA2MpW-czo-CYKNjocvQfj_uCE1jRhh_Q)
   - 3.1. The per-competitor price for Band 5 is called the Base Due amount. The per-competitor price for all other bands is a fraction of the Base Due amount.
   - 3.2. The Base Due amount is an amount set by the WFC that the countries in the most expensive band will pay. All other band Due amounts will be amounts less than this amount, and based on that country’s Cost of Living value (COL value) relative to the COL value of the countries in the most expensive band.
      - 3.2.1. Countries in Band 0 do not owe Dues to the WCA for any competitions held while that country maintains Band 0 status.
         - 3.2.1.1. See Appendix C for an explanation of how Band 0 will be used by the WFC.

## Appendix B
### 3x3x3 Fewest Moves simultaneous competitions
1. The overall competition Due amount will be the sum of the per-competition Due amounts for each of the locations.
   - 1.1. The competitors’ nationalities will not be used. The country or countries of the locations will be used.
   - 1.2. The following is an example to clarify:
      - 1.2.1. If 10 competitors are competing in Country A with a per-competitor due amount of $0.40 and 20 competitors are competing in country B with a per-competitor due amount of $0.30, then the competition overall has a Due amount owed of (10*$0.40 + 20*$0.30) = $10.00.
2. WCA Delegates must pay the Due amount owed for their location (Exception: The entire outstanding competition Due amount owed, minus any payments made by individual Delegates on behalf of their location, may be covered in full by the organizers, sponsors, or other party on behalf of the whole competition).
   - 2.1. For example, the following are all acceptable:
      - 2.1.1. Each Delegate of each location can pay the Due amount for a competition in their country, using their country’s per-competitor amount and the number of competitors who attended at their location.
         - 2.1.1.1. For example, the Delegate for Country A in the example above would pay 10*$0.40 = $4.00 and the Delegate for Country B above would pay 20*$0.30 = $6.00.
      - 2.1.2. The competition organizer, sponsor, or other party on behalf of the competition may pay the entire due amount for the competition less any payments already received from Delegates on behalf of their location.
   - 2.2. If the full Due amount owed is not received by the 7 day deadline, then any individual delegates who have not paid the Due amount owed for their location will not be allowed to announce a new competition as the Delegate. This will be enforced until either the Delegate pays the Due amount owed for their location, or the remaining unpaid competition Due amount owed for the entire competition is covered in full by another party.

## Appendix C
### WFC Use of Band 0 for countries that do not owe Dues
1. Band 0 countries are countries which do not owe any Dues to the WCA for competitions held in their country.
   - 1.1. This only applies for competitions that were held in the country while the country maintained a Band 0 status.
2. Countries whose economy and/or currency deflate in value tremendously due to economic or world events will be given Band 0 status during the time of the country’s financial instability.
   - 2.1. This will be handled on a case-by-base basis and will be tracked using world news and other economic indicators that show that a country is experiencing financial hardship.
   - 2.2. Once the country’s currency returns to a more normal level, and once economic indicators and/or world news report that the country is out of its period of financial instability, then the WFC will place the country into the proper band based on its Cost of Living (COL) value at that time.
3. Countries who have newly joined the WCA will be placed into Band 0 for a limited period of time.
   - 3.1. New countries will keep their Band 0 status until the first of the following events occurs:
      - 3.1.1. After 5 competitions have been completed in the country, they will be placed into a band based on the country’s Cost of Living (COL) value.
      - 3.1.2. When 2 years have passed since the first competition in that country has completed, then the country will be placed into a band based on the country’s COL value.
