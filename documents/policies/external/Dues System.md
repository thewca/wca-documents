# WCA Dues System Policy

### Version 1.10 {.version}

## Purpose
The WCA Dues System is a program by which the WCA will collect revenue on a per-competitor-per-competition basis from WCA Delegates and/or Regional Organizations in order to further the Mission and the Spirit of the WCA. The policy intends that WCA Delegates and/or Regional Organizations will fund the amount owed either by charging registration fees to their competitors, soliciting competition sponsors, or by using some other means of collecting money on behalf of their respective communities.

## Policy
1. Any WCA Delegate who delegates a competition will be responsible for paying Dues after the competition has finished.
   1. Exception: a Regional Organization may nominate itself to be responsible for the payment of WCA Dues in the region which they cover.
   2. Exception: World Championships, Continental Championships, and 3x3x3 Fewest Moves simultaneous competitions that take place in more than one country are exempt from paying Dues.
   3. Exception: at the discretion of the WCA Board, National Championships in certain countries may be exempt from paying Dues.
   4. Exception: at the discretion of the WCA Financial Committee (WFC), competitions in certain countries may be exempt from paying Dues based on the criteria in Appendix B.
2. WCA Delegates or Regional Organizations may allow the competition organizers or some other individual or organization involved with the competition to pay the Dues on their behalf. It remains the responsibility of the WCA Delegate(s) or Regional Organization to ensure that the invoice is paid on time, even if it will be paid by someone else.
   1. Exception: Individuals residing in and organizations based in countries subject to financial restrictions under the WCA Regional Restrictions Policy may not pay the Dues on behalf of a WCA Delegate or Regional Organization.
   2. Exception: A WCA Delegate whose assigned country is subject to financial restrictions under the WCA Regional Restrictions Policy who delegates a competition in a country not subject to financial restrictions must have an individual or organization not subject to financial restrictions pay the Dues on their behalf.
3. After a WCA Delegate submits the results for a competition and the results are posted by the WCA Results Team (WRT), the WFC will send a Delegate of the competition or the responsible Regional Organization an invoice detailing the total Dues amount owed.
   1. The WCA Delegate(s) or Regional Organization will have 30 days to pay the invoice from the date the invoice was sent. If payment is not received within 30 days of the date issued, the Delegate or Regional Organization is considered late on their Dues payment.
      1. Delegates or Regional Organizations who are not able to pay their Dues within 30 days should contact the WFC as soon as possible with a reason why payment cannot be made on time.
         1. On a case-by-case basis, the WFC will evaluate if the Delegate or Regional Organization is experiencing an exceptional circumstance preventing timely payment. In such cases, special accommodations may be made on a one-time basis, including but not limited to officially extending the due date for payment or waiving the Dues amount in part or in full.
      2. A Delegate with one or more late outstanding Dues payments is subject to probation according to the WCA Delegate Probationary Status Policy.
   2. WCA Delegates or Regional Organizations may pay the Dues amount using PayPal, Stripe (card payment), or bank transfer.
      1. Details for how to make these payments will be included in the invoice sent to the Delegate or Regional Organization.
      2. Invoices paid via bank transfer will receive a 2% rebate, provided in the form of credit that can be applied to future Dues invoices.
   3. The Dues amount owed for a competition will be calculated on a per-competitor basis.
      1. Each competition will have a per-competitor Dues amount owed, calculated according to Appendix A.
      2. The total amount owed for the competition will be the per-competitor Dues amount owed multiplied by the number of competitors who participated in the competition.

## Appendix A {.page-break-before}
### Detailed description of how per-competitor Dues amounts are calculated
1. A competition’s per-competitor Dues amount will be the Dues amount based on the country band OR the Dues amount based on registration fees, whichever is greater, as calculated below.
2. The country used to determine the per-competitor Dues amount is the country in which the competition takes place.
   1. 3x3x3 Fewest Moves simultaneous competitions that take place in more than one country are exempt from paying Dues.
3. Countries are assigned into one of six bands with an associated per-competitor Dues amount, with updates made periodically at the discretion of the WFC.
   1. The per-competitor Dues amount for Band 5 is called the Base Due amount and is set by this policy at USD $3.00. The per-competitor Dues amount for all other bands is a fraction of the Base Due amount as determined and periodically updated by the WFC.
     1. The per-competitor Dues amount for Band 0 is always zero as countries in Band 0 are not subject to Dues.
   2. A region not recognized separately by the WCA may be subject to a different country band from the country it falls within, based on geographic separation and/or economic differences, at the discretion of the WFC.
4. To determine the Dues amount based on the country band, look up the competition’s band and the associated per-competitor Dues amount in the [country bands list](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/wfc/country-bands).
5. To determine the Dues amount based on registration fees, follow the flow below:
   1. For countries in Bands 4 and 5, the Dues amount based on registration fees is equal to 15% of the base registration fee as stated on the WCA website, as converted to US Dollars based on the exchange rate on the final day of the competition.
   2. For countries in Band 3, the Dues amount based on registration fees is equal to 10% of the base registration fee as stated on the WCA website, as converted to US Dollars based on the exchange rate on the final day of the competition.
   3. For countries in Bands 1 and 2, the Dues amount based on registration fees is equal to 5% of the base registration fee as stated on the WCA website, as converted to US Dollars based on the exchange rate on the final day of the competition.
   4. For Band 0, the Dues amount based on registration fees is always zero as countries in Band 0 are not subject to Dues.
6. For the purpose of calculating the Dues amount based on registration fees, the base registration fee as stated on the WCA website must be equal to the minimum payment required to register for at least one event by a competitor who is not a member of any group eligible for a lowered/waived registration fee.
   1. Exception: if all competitors have an equal opportunity to become a member of a group eligible for a lowered/waived registration fee at no additional cost, the base registration fee may be set to the amount required to register by a member of that group.

## Appendix B {.page-break-before}
### WFC use of Band 0 for countries that do not owe Dues
1. Band 0 countries are countries which do not owe any Dues to the WCA for competitions held there.
   1. This only applies for competitions that are held while the country maintains a Band 0 status.
2. Band 0 status applies when a country meets one or more of the following conditions:
   1. The country has newly joined the WCA (at most 5 competitions have been completed in the country).
      1. A region not recognized separately by the WCA may be treated as having newly joined the WCA and therefore be eligible for Band 0 status, based on geographic separation and/or economic differences from the country it falls within, at the discretion of the WFC.
   2. The country is subject to financial restrictions according to the Regional Restrictions Policy.
      1. If the country’s financial restrictions under the Regional Restrictions policy are lifted, then the WFC will return the country to the band in which it would otherwise be placed.
   3. The country faces substantial difficulties making payments to the WCA via the supported payment methods due to their financial system and/or laws.
      1. This will be handled on a case-by-base basis at the discretion of the WFC after they become aware of the issue.
      2. If the country’s financial system advances or laws change to allow for payment through one or more of the supported methods, then the WFC will return the country to the band in which it would otherwise be placed.
   4. The country is experiencing economic and/or currency instability.
      1. This will be handled on a case-by-base basis at the discretion of the WFC after they become aware of the issue.
      2. Once economic indicators and/or world news support the conclusion that the country’s economic and/or currency situation has stabilized, then the WFC will return the country to the band in which it would otherwise be placed.
   5. The country has experienced a severe setback in its cubing community, including but not limited to: no longer having a local Delegate, the cancellation/failure of a major competition for reasons outside the Delegates’ control, a major fraud event, etc.
      1. This will be handled on a case-by-base basis at the discretion of the WFC after they become aware of the issue.
      2. Once the country’s cubing community has been restored to a self-sustaining level, then the WFC will return the country to the band in which it would otherwise be placed.
