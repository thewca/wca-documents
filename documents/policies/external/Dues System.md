# WCA Dues System Policy

### Version 1.6 {.version}

## Purpose
The WCA Dues System is a policy by which the WCA will collect revenue on a per-competitor-per-competition basis from WCA Delegates and/or Regional Organizations in order to further the Mission and the Spirit of the WCA. The policy intends that WCA Delegates and/or Regional Organizations will fund the amount owed either by charging registration fees to their competitors, soliciting competition sponsors, or by using some other means of collecting money on behalf of their respective countries.

## Policy
1. Any WCA Delegate who delegates will be responsible for paying Dues after the competition has finished 
   1. Exception: a Regional Organisation may nominate themselves to be responsible for the payment of WCA dues in the region in which they cover.
   2. Exception: WCA World Championships, WCA Continental Championships, and 3x3x3 Fewest Moves simultaneous competitions that take place in more than one country are exempt from paying Dues
   3. Exception: at the discretion of the WCA Financial Committee (WFC) competitions in a particular country or set of countries may be exempt from paying Dues based on the number of competitions held in that country to date or due to economic and/or currency instability or challenges with making payment to the WCA. See Appendix B. 
2. WCA Delegates or Regional Organizations may allow the competition organizers or other official organization to pay the Dues on their behalf. 
   1. It is the responsibility of the WCA Delegate(s) or Regional Organization to ensure that the invoice is paid on time, even if it will be paid by someone else.
3. After a WCA Delegate submits the results for their competition and the results are posted by the WCA Results Team (WRT), the WCA Financial Committee (WFC) will send the Delegate or Regional Organization an invoice detailing the total Due amount owed.
   1. WCA Delegate(s) or Regional Organization will have 30 days to pay the invoice counting from the time the invoice was sent.
   2. If payment is not received by 30 days, the Delegate or Regional Organization is considered late on their dues payment.
      1. Delegates or Regional Organizations who are not able to pay their Dues within 30 days should contact the WFC with a reason why payment cannot be made on time. 
         1. Invoices not paid within 60 days of the date issued may be subject to disciplinary action.
            1. On a case-by-case basis the WFC will evaluate if the Delegate is experiencing an exceptional circumstance for why payment cannot be made on time. In such cases, special accommodations may be made on a one-time basis including but not limited to: delaying the due date for payment, or waiving the Dues amount in part or in full.
            2. If Delegates do not have a valid reason for the late payment (i.e. an exceptional circumstance), then the Delegates will not be allowed to announce any new competitions or place any new gear orders as Delegate until their outstanding balance is paid.
      2. Delegates with chronically late payments will be referred to their Senior Delegates for follow-up to ensure that future Dues are received on time.
         1. Frequent late payments may result in disciplinary action.
   3. WCA Delegates or Regional Organizations may pay the Due amount using either PayPal, bank transfer or Stripe (card payment).
      1. Details for how to make these payments will be included in the invoice sent to the Delegate.
4. The Due amount owed for a competition will be calculated on a per-competitor-per-competition basis.
   1. Each competition will have a per-competitor Due amount owed.
   2. The total amount owed for the competition will be the per-competitor Due amount owed multiplied by the number of competitors who participated in the competition.
   3. The per-competitor Due amount will be the higher of the Due amount based on the country band and the Due amount based on registration fees, see Appendix A


## Appendix A {.page-break-before}
### Detailed description of how per-competitor due amounts are calculated
To calculate the Due amount owed for a competition, the following procedure will be used:

1. The country used to determine the Due amount is the country in which the competition takes place.
   1. For 3x3x3 Fewest Moves simultaneous competitions that take place in more than one country, the Due amount will be waived.
2. Countries will be grouped together into 6 Bands based on their Cost of Living values. <br> Countries are assigned to a band according to [this list](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/wfc/country-bands) with updates made periodically at the discretion of the WFC.
3. To determine the per-competitor Due amount based on the country band, look up the competition’s band, then find its per-competitor price using [this list](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/wfc/country-bands).
   1. The per-competitor price for Band 5 is called the Base Due amount. The per-competitor price for all other bands is a fraction of the Base Due amount.
   2. The Base Due amount is an amount set per this policy at USD $3. All other band Due amounts will be amounts less than this amount as determined by the WFC.
      1. Countries in Band 0 do not owe Dues to the WCA for any competitions held while that country maintains Band 0 status.
         1. See Appendix B for an explanation of how Band 0 will be used by the WFC.
4. The Due amount based on registration fees will be: 
   1. For bands 3, 4, and 5 countries: equal to 15% of base registration fee as stated on the WCA website, converted to US Dollars.
   2. For bands 1 and 2 countries: equal to 5% of the base registration fee as stated on the WCA website, converted to US Dollars.
   3. For band 0 countries: zero
5. The final Due amount per competitor will be the higher of the Due amount based on the country band and the Due amount based on registration fees.

## Appendix B {.page-break-before}
### WFC Use of Band 0 for countries that do not owe Dues
1. Band 0 countries are countries which do not owe any Dues to the WCA for competitions held in their country.
   1. This only applies for competitions that were held in the country while the country maintained a Band 0 status.
2. Countries placed on a restricted region list per the Regional Restriction Policy, who experience economic and/or currency instability, or who have challenges making payments to the WCA due to their financial systems will be given Band 0.
   1. This will be handled on a case-by-base basis at the discretion of the WFC.
   2. Once the country’s currency returns to a more normal level, and once economic indicators and/or world news report that the country is out of its period of financial instability, then the WFC will place the country into the proper band based on its Cost of Living (COL) value at that time.
3. Countries who have newly joined the WCA will be placed into Band 0 for a limited period of time.
   1. New countries will keep their Band 0 status until the first of the following events occurs:
      1. After 5 competitions have been completed in the country, they will be placed into a band based on the country’s Cost of Living (COL) value.
      2. When 2 years have passed since the first competition in that country has completed, then the country will be placed into a band based on the country’s COL value.
