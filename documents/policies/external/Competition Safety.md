# WCA Competition Safety Policy

### Version 1.7 {.version}

## Purpose
This policy provides a directive from the Board of Directors of The World Cube Association (WCA) to all WCA Staff and WCA Community Members on measures that must be abided by and recommendations with regard COVID-19 to ensure that WCA Competitions adhere to localized governmental policy and we minimize the spread of infection amongst not only our own WCA Community, but the wider public as we return to competitions.

## Scope
This policy applies to all WCA Staff, WCA Competition Organizers and WCA Community members in their capacity as competitors, volunteers or spectators at WCA Competitions. This policy sets out WCAâ€™s commitment in relation to:

1. Approach to the holding and cancellation of WCA Competitions
2. Directives and recommendations at WCA Competitions to minimize the spread of the virus.

Since the WCA itself does not organize competitions, the WCA are not responsible for damage or injury incurred at WCA-recognized competitions, including contraction of COVID-19. 

## Policy
### Return to competitions
In order for a competition to be approved and sanctioned by the WCA the WCA Delegate(s) must prove to the Board of Directors beyond a reasonable doubt that holding of competitions in the region is safe and the following conditions are met:

1. Public gatherings are allowed by law in the jurisdiction in which the competition will take place (relevant government or state website links will be required to verify);
2. The competitor limit is not greater than half the maximum number of people allowed at public gatherings;
   1. Combined limits on spectators and competitors are not permitted although separate competitor and spectator limits are encouraged.
3. There is no legal or venue requirement for mandatory social distancing and;
4. There is no guidance from local governments that prohibits the running of the competition.

The Board may delegate the responsibility of checking these requirements to the WCAT.

The Board of Directors retains the right to require other conditions to be met in order for a competition to be recognized and sanctioned by the WCA. Additionally the Board has the right at any time to withdraw approval and cancel a competition where it may no longer be possible to hold safely.

The recommendations set forth in this policy may be waived at the discretion of the WCA Board, if community transmissions are near-zero within the region the competition serves and the competition abides by all local government advice. 

### Holding of competitions
In addition to the above section on requirements for return to competitions, the following are requirements for organizers who have approval to continue with their competitions:

1. Fixed seating must be used for competitors. 
   1. Each competitor is to have the same judge for the duration of the round.
2. Distance between all competitors and judges whilst at solving stations must be at least 1m (3 ft.)
3. Hand sanitizer must be made available to scramblers at scrambling tables, and also made available to competitors and spectators in the venue.

## Official Guidance
### General Advice
The WCA recommends that the advice of the World Health Organization is read and followed:

1. [WHO COVID-19 Main Page](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)
2. [Protective Advice](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)
3. [Travel Advice](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/travel-advice)

Please also refer to government resources in your own Country or Region. Be mindful of the amount of misinformation available on social media with regard to COVID-19 so use government recommended sites and advice.

## Conflict of Advice
In the case where there is conflicting advice between the WCA and local governments it is required that the more restrictive requirement is followed unless explicitly approved prior to the competition announcement.

## Review
This policy is considered permanently in effect until repealed by the Board of Directors. The Board will be responsible for reviewing the policy fortnightly and providing appropriate updates to the community.
