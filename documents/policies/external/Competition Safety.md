# WCA Competition Safety Policy
<div class="version">
### Version 1.4
</div>

## Purpose
This policy provides a directive from the Board of Directors of The World Cube Association (WCA) to all WCA Staff and WCA Community Members on measures that must be abided by and recommendations with regard COVID-19 to ensure that WCA Competitions adhere to localized governmental policy and we minimize the spread of infection amongst not only our own WCA Community, but the wider public as we return to competitions.

## Scope
This policy applies to all WCA Staff, WCA Competition Organizers and WCA Community members in their capacity as competitors, volunteers or spectators at WCA Competitions. This policy sets out WCA’s commitment in relation to:

1. Approach to the holding and cancellation of WCA Competitions
2. Directives and recommendations at WCA Competitions to minimize the spread of the virus.

Since the WCA itself does not organize competitions, the WCA are not responsible for damage or injury incurred at WCA-recognized competitions, including contraction of COVID-19. 

## Policy
### Return to competitions
In order for a competition to be approved and sanctioned by the WCA the WCA Delegate(s) must prove to the Board of Directors beyond a reasonable doubt that holding of competitions in the region is safe and the following conditions are met:

1. Public gatherings are allowed by law in the jurisdiction in which the competition will take place (relevant government or state website links will be required to verify);
2. The competitor limit is not greater than half the maximum number of people allowed at public gatherings;
   1. Combined limits on spectators and competitors are not permitted although separate competitor and spectator limits are encouraged.
3. There is no legal or venue requirement for mandatory social distancing;
4. There is no guidance from local governments that prohibits the running of the competition and;
5. The WCA Delegate and Organizers produce a detailed risk management plan outlining all steps being taken to ensure that the competition is run as safely and efficiently as possible.

The Board of Directors retains the right to require other conditions to be met in order for a competition to be recognized and sanctioned by the WCA. Additionally the Board has the right at any time to withdraw approval and cancel a competition where it may no longer be possible to hold safely.

The recommendations set forth in this policy may be waived at the discretion of the WCA Board, if community transmissions are near-zero within the region the competition serves and the competition abides by all local government advice.
