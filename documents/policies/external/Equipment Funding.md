# WCA Equipment Funding Policy
<div class="version">
### Version 1.1
</div>

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to offer a process and procedure for the WCA to invest in the equipment necessary to run WCA Competitions for countries or regions where their own investment is hindered by financial or other hardship.

## Policy
### Equipment covered
The following equipment is covered by the policy:

1. Officially recognized timing equipment
   1. Timers
   2. Mats
   3. Displays
2. Stopwatches
3. Consumables
   1. Batteries
   2. Ink/Toner
   3. Other
4. Other essential equipment

Not all the above listed equipment will be funded for each application. The funding for each application will assess what equipment is needed on a case by case basis.

### Qualification
Competition equipment will only be funded by the WCA when there is strong evidence that the Delegates for a country or region lack the financial resources to fund the equipment themselves, and that registration fees cannot reasonably be used to purchase equipment without substantial hardship for competitors.

### Approval process
An application for funding needs to be submitted by a WCA Staff Member, outlining the following:

1. A list of the equipment they currently have access to.
2. An explanation of the reasoning why they require WCA financial assistance.
3. A list of the qualifying equipment they wish to purchase.
4. An indication of how often the equipment will be used for WCA Competitions.
5. The WCA Staff or Regional Organization who will act as custodians for the equipment.

The WCA Board of Directors will assess the case and may ask the assistance of any other WCA Committee or Team that may help them reach a decision. Once the application has been researched and considered, the WCA Board of Directors will vote on the application.

The WCA Board of Directors will inform the applicant of the decision and, if the request is granted, indicate whether the WCA will be financially supporting the purchase in full or part.

### Acquisition and delivery
The method of obtaining the equipment will vary.

All officially recognized timing equipment will be ordered directly by the WCA and delivered to a representative of the WCA who will then arrange onward delivery.

For all other equipment, the WCA Financial Committee will purchase the equipment directly, reimburse with receipts within 30 days, or make an advance of funds to the applicant. The applicant will then purchase the equipment and let the WCA have receipts/invoices for the equipment within a period of 30 days and a refund of any funds not directly used for the equipment or its delivery. Failure to use the funds for the purpose they have been provided may lead to WCA disciplinary procedures and/or legal action.

### Equipment custodian responsibilities
The World Cube Association will remain the owners of the purchased equipment and reserves the right to require its return (at the expense of the WCA) at any time. However, a custodian will be appointed to hold, maintain, and care for the equipment. Failure to return the equipment upon request or returning the equipment in unsatisfactory condition may result in WCA disciplinary procedures and/or legal action.

Risk for any loss or damage to the equipment passes to the custodians upon delivery. Equipment custodians are expected to take proper care of equipment (fair wear and tear expected) and track them if loaned to another Delegate or organizer.

All equipment must be clearly labeled with the WCA logo and asset identification label (provided by the WCA).

All equipment must only be used for WCA Competitions. Exception: WCA funded equipment may be used for other WCA activities with the express written permission from the WCA Board of Directors.
