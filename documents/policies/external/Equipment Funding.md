# WCA Equipment Funding Policy

### Version 2.1 {.version}

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to offer a set of procedures by which the WCA can invest in the equipment necessary to run WCA Competitions in regions where their own ability to obtain equipment is hindered by financial obstacles, in order to further the Mission and the Spirit of the WCA.

## Policy
### Qualifying Equipment
The following equipment is covered by the policy:

1. Timing equipment
   1. Officially recognized timers and compatible mats
   2. Displays
   3. Accessories (data cords, power supplies, brackets)
2. Other equipment required by the Regulations 
   1. Stopwatches
   2. Cube covers
3. Consumable equipment
   1. Batteries
   2. Ink/toner
   3. Pens
4. Other competition equipment
   1. Laptops
   2. Printers
   3. Equipment for transporting other equipment (bins, hand trucks, etc.)

### Eligibility
Competition equipment can be funded by the WCA when there is strong evidence that the Delegates for a region lack the financial resources to purchase competition equipment themselves without sacrificing the ability to conduct WCA-related activities of equal or greater importance, with priority given to those with the greatest overall financial need.

### Approval Process
An application for funding must be submitted by a WCA Delegate or acknowledged WCA Regional Organization, outlining the following: 

1. A list of the equipment they currently have access to. 
2. A list of the qualifying equipment they wish the WCA to purchase on their behalf.
3. For all equipment that is not timing equipment, the cost of the equipment along with documentation of the cost.
4. An explanation of why they are not able to purchase the equipment themselves or the conflicting financial priorities that would have to be sacrificed to purchase the equipment.
5. An estimate of how often the equipment will be used for WCA Competitions. 
6. The WCA Staff, Trainee Delegate or Regional Organization who will act as custodian for the equipment. 

The WCA Financial Committee (WFC) will evaluate the application, asking for assistance from the WCA Board of Directors, other WCA Committee or Teams, WCA Staff Members, or outside sources as needed. Once the application has been researched and considered, the WFC will vote on whether to fund the requested equipment fully, partially, or not at all. The WFC will then inform the applicant of the decision.

The funding decision for each application will be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the merits of the application and the budgeted amount for equipment approved by the WCA Board of Directors.

### Procurement
The method of procuring the equipment will vary. The WCA will use one of the following options based on the type of equipment and the applicant’s situation:

1. Purchasing the equipment directly and having it delivered to the applicant.
2. Reimbursing the applicant for purchasing the equipment themselves. In this case, the applicant must provide all receipts for the equipment purchase within 30 days of making the purchase in order to be reimbursed.
3. Making an advance of funds to the applicant for purchasing the equipment themselves. In this case, the applicant must purchase the equipment, provide all receipts, and refund any funds not used for the equipment purchase within 30 days of receiving the advance. Failure to use the funds for the purpose they have been provided may lead to WCA disciplinary procedures and/or legal action.

### Equipment Custodian
The WCA will remain the owner of the purchased equipment and reserves the right to require its return (at the expense of the WCA) at any time. However, as part of the application process, one or more custodians will be approved by the WFC to hold, maintain, and care for the equipment. A custodian must be a WCA Staff Member, a WCA Trainee Delegate, or an acknowledged WCA Regional Organization. 

Risk for any loss or damage to the equipment passes to the custodian upon delivery, and any loss or damage must be promptly reported to the WFC. Equipment custodians are expected to take proper care of equipment (though regular wear and tear is expected) and remain accountable for loss or damage even if it is temporarily loaned to another Delegate or organizer. The custodian will also be responsible for promptly responding to any inquiries from the WFC about the status, location, and use of the equipment. 

All WCA-funded equipment must only be used for WCA Competitions or activities that promote speedcubing in the community and align with the WCA’s mission statement, spirit, and goals. Any other use of the equipment requires the express written permission of the WCA Financial Committee.

Failure to return the equipment in a timely fashion upon request or returning the equipment in unsatisfactory condition may result in WCA disciplinary procedures and/or legal action.

#### Handover of Equipment to a New Custodian
If a custodian wishes to permanently hand over some or all of their WCA-funded equipment to a new custodian, they should notify the WFC before making the transfer. The WFC reserves the right to deny the transfer and require that the original custodian continue in their role. If the transfer is allowed to proceed, the new custodian must familiarize themselves with the responsibilities required of the role as described in this policy. Any shipping costs necessary to convey the equipment to its new custodian as a result of the original custodian voluntarily handing over their equipment while retaining eligibility to serve as a custodian are at the expense of the original or new custodian, not the WCA.

A custodian may also lose the ability to serve in their role, either through resignation or removal of their qualifying status within the WCA or by a decision of the WFC to remove their custodian role. A custodian who loses their role entirely must hand over their WCA-funded equipment in a timely fashion to another qualifying party who is approved by the WFC and willing to assume the role as the new custodian. The new custodian must familiarize themselves with the responsibilities required of the role as described in this policy. Any shipping costs necessary to convey the equipment to its new custodian as a result of the original custodian losing their role are at the expense of the WCA.

Failure to hand the equipment over to a new custodian upon loss of the custodian role may result in WCA disciplinary procedures and/or legal action.
