   3. Competitions will be accepted regarding proximity if there are no other competitions within 10 km driving distance and less than 5 days away.
      1. Otherwise, the WCA Competition Announcement Team should review the circumstances of the proposed competition. The WCA Delegate requesting approval for such a competition must provide further information on why the competition should still be accepted. Possible arguments that support such a competition being accepted include:

         2. All competitions within the same series should be submitted and announced together.
            1. A series may have an additional competition announced at a later time if it has identical events to another competition in the series, and if it still fulfills all other requirements for a regular competition.

      3. The qualification result is based on the last day of the competition at which it was achieved.
   2. If the competitor limit for a competition or an event is reached before the competition, the organization team must not approve any additional registrations for the competition or the event.
