# WCA Delegate Management Policy

### Version 1.0 {.version}

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define a standardized system to manage WCA Delegates, from candidate application to continuous evaluation of appointed Delegates.

## Policy
### Application

1. Any member of the WCA Community willing to apply for the Trainee Delegate role must submit a candidacy document in English to their Senior and Regional Delegates.
    1. The following information should be included:
        1. Brief personal introduction.
        2. Summary of activities done for the WCA and their local community.
        3. Name of at least one Junior or Full Delegate who can recommend them for the position.
        4. Motivation to apply for the position.
    2. If the information is found to be insufficient, the Senior or Regional Delegate may request the applicant to submit a new candidacy document.
2. An application may be rejected solely based on the candidacy document.
    1. The applicant may contact the WCA Quality Assurance Committee (WQAC) at [quality@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:quality@worldcubeassociation.org) if they believe their application is being rejected without a justified reason.
3. If the application is rejected at any point during the process, the applicant may re-apply under the following conditions:
    1. The applicant must wait at least one month before submitting a new application.
    2. The same person cannot apply more than three times in one calendar year.
4. The Senior Delegate should prioritize applications based on the needs of each region.
    1. An application must not be delayed indefinitely in favor of other regions.
5. If the Senior Delegate determines that the applicant meets the requirements described in point 4.1 of [WCA Motion : TODO - Trainee Delegates](wcadoc{documents/motions/TODO - Trainee Delegates.pdf}), and they do not have any additional concerns surrounding the applicant, the process moves forward to the interview phase.

### Interview

1. If approved by the Senior Delegate, the candidacy document must be followed by an interview.
    1. The main language used in the interview must be English.
    2. The interview must include the Senior Delegate and/or the Regional Delegate for the candidate’s region and at least one WQAC member from a different country.
        1. There must be no more than three interviewers in total.
2. The Senior Delegate shares the application document with the WQAC before scheduling the interview with the applicant.
3. The interview may include general questions about the candidate’s application.
4. The interview should include general questions about the structure, Mission, Spirit, Policies, and Regulations of the WCA, including but not limited to:
    1. The requirements of holding a WCA competition.
    2. Competition organization.
    3. Common incidents that can occur at WCA competitions that can be resolved with a fair amount of knowledge of the WCA Regulations and Guidelines.
    4. Handling conflicts of interest.
    5. Handling disciplinary situations.
    6. The candidate’s collaboration and communication skills, as well as general professionalism.
5. After the interview, the WQAC shares their feedback with the Senior Delegate, who must carefully consider it before making any final decision.
    1. If the Senior Delegate decides against the WQAC’s recommendations, they must explicitly note this when proposing the candidate to the WCA Board.
6. The Senior Delegate approves the candidate’s application by submitting a proposal to the WCA Board.

### Training

1. If the candidate is approved by the WCA Board for the Trainee Delegate role, they proceed to the training phase as a Trainee Delegate.
    1. References to “Trainee Delegate” in this section also apply to candidates who are promoted directly to Junior Delegate by the Senior Delegate.
2. The Senior and/or Regional Delegate must make sure that the Trainee Delegate is aware of and has access to all of the relevant training material for their role, such as the WCA Learning Management System (LMS).
3. A set of one or more mentors is selected by the Senior and/or Regional Delegate to mentor the Trainee Delegate during the training phase.
    1. Each mentor must be a Junior or Full Delegate, preferably a Full Delegate. The Senior and Regional Delegate may also select themselves as mentors.
    2. The mentor(s) must instruct the Trainee Delegate to read the WCA Regulations, the Code of Ethics, the Code of Conduct, as well as all Policies and Motions relevant to WCA Delegates during the training phase.
    3. The mentor(s) must monitor the Trainee Delegate’s progress in applying their knowledge of WCA Documents throughout the course of any WCA competition the Trainee Delegate is delegating.
    4. The mentor(s) should actively offer their assistance and guidance to the Trainee Delegate.
    5. When the mentor(s) deem that the Trainee Delegate is ready to be considered for a promotion to Junior Delegate, they reach out to their Senior and/or Regional Delegate to move forward with the process.
        1. If the mentors are unable to agree on the Trainee Delegate’s promotion, the Senior and Regional Delegates make the final decision. In this case, the Senior and Regional Delegates must consider feedback from all the mentors involved.
    6. A mentor may reach out to their Senior and/or Regional Delegate at any point during the training phase if they believe that the Trainee Delegate has exhibited any concerning behavior.
        1. This includes anything where the mentor does not see any possibility for the Trainee Delegate to improve or if the Trainee Delegate’s integrity turns out to be questionable.
        2. This should not be done for mistakes that are natural in any learning process.
4. The Senior and/or Regional Delegates should check in with the mentor(s) if they do not see any progress in the Trainee Delegate’s training, especially if the appointment period is due to end soon, as per point 5.2 of [WCA Motion : TODO - Trainee Delegates](wcadoc{documents/motions/TODO - Trainee Delegates.pdf}).
5. In order to be considered for promotion, the Trainee Delegate must:
    1. Complete the Trainee to Junior Delegate course through the WCA’s LMS platform up to but excluding the final evaluation.
    2. Delegate at least one WCA competition.

### Evaluation

1. If the Senior Delegate agrees with the mentor(s) that the Trainee Delegate is ready for promotion, the Trainee Delegate can proceed to the evaluation phase.
    1. A Delegate who was promoted directly to Junior Delegate must complete the Trainee to Junior Delegate evaluation phase.
        1. Junior Delegates who are promoted without going through a trainee phase due to geographic need must fully complete the Trainee assessment and training phase.
        2. Junior Delegates who previously held the Delegate role, left the position, and were given the role again after a period of less than 3 years, will need to complete the Trainee evaluation, but will not be required to complete the training phase.
2. The evaluation consists of a set of multiple-choice questions, to be completed through the WCA’s LMS platform.
    1. Questions are randomly selected from a set of questions maintained by the WQAC and the relevant Teams and Committees (e.g. WIC, WRC).
    2. Questions may encompass all topics mentioned in point 9 of this document, but more in-depth; other topics may be included as well.
    3. All topics that could appear in the final evaluation must be covered in the Trainee to Junior Delegate course.
3. The candidate must not receive any help from other people while taking the evaluation, otherwise they will be demoted from the Trainee Delegate position.
    1. The candidate may use any WCA Documents during the evaluation.
    2. The candidate may request special accommodations from the WQAC, such as an interpreter. Candidates requesting such accommodations should contact the WQAC at least two weeks before the evaluation.
4. The candidate passes the evaluation if they obtain a minimum score of 70%.
5. If the candidate obtains a score strictly below 70%, they may request to retake the evaluation after one week of their previous attempt.
6. The candidate may take the evaluation up to three times in the 12-month period starting at the time of their appointment as a Trainee Delegate.
    1. The candidate would gain three additional attempts every time their appointment is extended as per point 5.2 of [WCA Motion : TODO - Trainee Delegates](wcadoc{documents/motions/TODO - Trainee Delegates.pdf}).

### Annual Evaluation

1. Junior and Full WCA Delegates must take an annual evaluation every year.
    1. An annual evaluation contains up-to-date information that has not been previously covered in previous evaluations as well as information that is covered in the Trainee to Junior training course.
    2. An annual evaluation includes, but is not limited to, questions about the WCA Regulations and Guidelines, the WCA Competition Requirements Policy and other relevant WCA Documents relevant to the role of Junior and Full WCA Delegates.
    3. Delegates who got promoted to Junior Delegate in a given calendar year are not required to complete the annual evaluation that year.
        1. If the Delegate was promoted between January 1 and April 30, they may choose to complete the annual evaluation that year.
        2. If new WCA policies come into effect after a Junior is promoted, they are expected to familiarize themselves with these new policies. In this case, Regional Delegates should check in with the Junior Delegate to ensure they are keeping up to date with new WCA policies.
    4. A Delegate may contact their Senior Delegate to request an exemption from an annual evaluation for a valid reason (e.g. military service, medical concerns, family responsibilities, etc.).
        1. In this case, if the Senior Delegate agrees that the reason is valid, they inform the WQAC, who processes the exemption in the LMS.
    5. Annual evaluations will be made available before March 1 every year.
2. An annual evaluation consists of a set of multiple choice questions, to be completed through the WCA’s LMS platform.
3. The Delegate must not receive any help from other people while taking an annual evaluation, otherwise they fail the annual evaluation.
    1. Exceptions outlined in points 19.1 and 19.2 of this policy apply to the annual evaluation.
4. The Delegate passes the annual evaluation if they obtain a minimum score of 70%.
    1. The Delegate may take the annual evaluation up to three times in a given calendar year.
        1. If the Delegate does not pass the annual evaluation, they may take it again after 24 hours, until they have used all three attempts.
    2. If the Delegate has not passed the annual evaluation by April 30, 23:59 UTC and has not used all three attempts, they are put on probation in accordance with the Probation Due to Annual Evaluation Issues section of the [Delegate Probationary Status Policy](wcadoc{documents/internal/Delegate Probationary Status.pdf}).
        1. To end the probationary period, the Delegate must pass the annual evaluation within their remaining attempts by the end of the calendar year.
    3. If the Delegate has taken three attempts and has not passed the annual evaluation, they are put on probation in accordance with the Probation Due to Annual Evaluation Issues section of the [Delegate Probationary Status Policy](wcadoc{documents/internal/Delegate Probationary Status.pdf}).
        1. To pass the probationary status evaluation and end the probationary period, the Delegate must either pass an interview with a Senior Delegate or Regional Delegate (selected by the WQAC) or pass the annual evaluation within three additional attempts, whichever they prefer. For the interview option, the following conditions apply:
            1. The main language used in the interview must be English.
            2. The interview must include at least one WQAC member from a different country.
5. The Delegate will lose their appointment in the following cases:
    1. If the Delegate fails the probationary status evaluation.
    2. If by the end of the calendar year, the Delegate has not completed their probationary status evaluation.
        1. An exemption may be given at the discretion of the Senior Delegate in consultation with WQAC.

### Supporting Delegate Education

1. The WQAC may require any Delegate (Trainee, Junior, or Full) to complete one-off evaluations in order to assess the level of Delegate education.
    1. Results from one-off evaluations for those who are not the target demographic may not be used to inform promotion or demotion decisions. Example: Junior or Full WCA Delegates taking the Trainee to Junior Course.
        1. Exception: If a Delegate does not comply with the WQAC’s request to take a one-off evaluation, the WQAC may document the refusal to participate as a quality issue in cases where the Delegate does not provide a justified reason.
2. Results from one-off evaluations may be used to inform Senior and/or Regional Delegates of demonstration of lack of knowledge about any of the content on the related course or any other issue seen by the WQAC.
    1. The information shared may only be used to report concerning patterns of behavior. Example: repeatedly failing one-off evaluations, missing three or more calls for participation, etc.
