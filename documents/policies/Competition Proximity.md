# WCA Competition Proximity Policy
<div class="version">
### Version 1.1
</div>

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to spread competitions in time and geographical areas. It also prevents abuse in which several competitions could be held within a short time frame in the same area with roughly the same competitors.

## Policy
1. WCA competitions will be accepted if there are no other competitions within 100 km driving distance and less than 19 days away.
2. Otherwise, the WCA Board should review the circumstances of the proposed competition. A Delegate requesting approval for such a competition must provide further information on why the competition should still be accepted. Possible arguments that support such a competition being accepted include:
    a. The two competitions donâ€™t have events in common.
    b. The two competitions take place in different countries.

### 3x3x3 Fewest Moves Simultaneous Competitions
A 3x3x3 Fewest Moves simultaneous competition is a WCA competition having only the 3x3x3 Fewest Moves event and taking place simultaneously in different locations.

1. A 3x3x3 Fewest Moves simultaneous competition cannot be part of any other regular competition.
    a. Time frames when both are held cannot overlap.
2. If any location of such competitions is closer than 100 km to any other competition, then
    a. both competitions should be at least 5 days apart, or
    b. the other competition must not have the 3x3x3 Fewest Moves event.

### Twin Competitions
Twin competitions are WCA Competitions that are held less than 5 days apart for which the distance between them is less than 100 km, with the intention to accommodate more competitors to compete in one area.

1. Twin competitions may be accepted if the need for competitions in an area is so great that the community will benefit from having multiple competitions held in a short period of time.
2. A competitor is only permitted to participate in one of the twin competitions.
    a. If a competitor competes at more than one of the involved twin competitions, only the results from the competition that they compete in first will be kept.
    b. Twin competitions are obliged to clearly and publicly state their condition of twin competitions and their special participation terms.
